;procedures
1,<strong>Procedures</strong>: <em>random encounters</em> are 1 in 6 per day and 1 in 6 per night if you’re not behind walls. Travel time is 1 hex/day without a trail, 2 hexes/day on a trail. If you’re <em>looking for something</em> that isn’t as obvious as a town or village built in plain sight, your chance of finding it is 1 in 6 per day; each search party also has to roll for their own random encounter. Underground encounters are 1 in 6 every two turns, e.g. whenever leaving a room.

;spells
1,<strong>Scrolls, prayers and spells</strong>: a <em>scroll</em> can only be read by magic users and elves that know the spell or have access to <em>read magic</em>; a <em>prayer</em> can be read by anyone. The spells are listed in <a href="#appendix-a">Appendix A</a>.

;treasure
1,<strong>Treasure</strong>: the value of a <em>gem</em> is determined by rolling a d20 and looking it up on the <a href="#gems">table</a>; the value of <em>jewelry</em> is determined by rolling 3d6×100gp.

# Dungeon

# At the start you save a dungeon type for theming, then on subsequent
# calls you reference what it’s stored as to pull in only certain
# “types” from specific tables. Also uses a “boss” monster in the
# final room of the key. You could make clue tables for the bosses
# that tie into the same monster list.

# Trap room features. General format: hint; hint; hint → effect;
# effect (no trailing punctuation; the intended use is as a list item.

# Concealed traps are sometimes used to protect treasure
;concealed trap
1,**net**: tripwires trigger a net falling from the ceiling → save vs. rays or be caught for 1d6 rounds; wood blocks attached along the edges cause a ruckus and attracts wandering monsters
1,**trap door**: hollow sound if tapped → 1–2 in 6: 10ft deep pit, take 1d6 damage
1,**concealed spiked pit**: hollow sound if tapped → 1–2 in 6: 10ft deep pit with sharpened spikes, take 2d6 damage
1,**tripwire poison arrow**: triggered by a pole; wall is nicked where arrows missed their target; single hole on the opposing side; visible wire when moving with a light source → roll an attack against the first person: 1d6 damage and save vs. poison or die

;trap
3,[concealed trap]
1,**checkerboard floor**: traces of dirt on the safe tiles; save vs. breath or take 2d6 damage unless you move like a [chess piece]
1,**chest**: [chest], sweet smell if examined closely → booby-trapped with sleep gas, all must save vs. poison or lose consciousness for 20min; two random encounter checks if all are affected
1,**darts**: walls nicked and holes on the opposing side; raised floor segment indicates pressure plate → roll attacks +0 against the first person: 1d4/1d4/1d4 damage
1,**deep pit**: a deep pit with a visibly crumbling edge supported by rotting wooden beams → 1–2 in 6 it collapses, fall 30ft for 3d6 damage
1,**falling rocks**: rickety construction with frail, rotten support beams; dirt falls → anything but careful sneaking triggers a ceiling collapse: all must save vs. death or die
1,**spiked iron grate**: fixed to the ceiling near the entrance; pressure plate connected by a wire → on 1–2 in 6 it swings down, save vs. breath or take 2d6 damage; locks into place, possibly separating party; requires a strength check to lift
1,**buried coffin**: knocking from below; swipe the dirt aside to reveal crumbling coffin; muffled cry: “help!” (or: “brains?”) → if stepped upon, 1–2 in 6 chance of the coffin breaking and the **zombie** grabbing a hold of the tasty foot ([zombie stats])
1,**hanging log**: hanging on the ceiling; trip wire → on 1–2 in 6 it swings down, save vs. breath or take 2d6 damage; also rams into the person behind you (if any)
1,**protective spear trap**: a hole in the wall at chest level; a pressure plate further back → on 1–2 in 6 it triggers a spear attack +0 for 1d6 on the person standing in front of the hole; can be triggered on purpose
1,**small catapult**: loaded with a ball-and-chain; trip wires → on 1–2 in 6 it triggers, save vs. breath or take 2d6
1,**turning trap door**: clean floor ahead; hollow sound if tapped → 1–2 in 6: 10ft deep pit, take 1d6 damage, floor plate is mounted on a rotating axis and turns over, locking in place again (requires similar weight to release), contains [dead human, dagger|bones, **ghoul** ([ghoul stats])|bones, **zombie** ([zombie stats])|[slime]]
1,**open spiked pit**: a narrow wooden beam leads across a pit 10ft wide and 10ft deep, spiked; wet and slippery → unless you’re an elf or a halfling: on 1–2 in 6 you slip and fall take 2d6
# Buffalo Castle 24A!
1,**fog chest**: [chest], traces of a metallic green condensate all over it; transformation magic detectable; a tiny plaque reads: [“🜁:🜚→🝗” (gold to ashes)|“🜁:🜛→🝗” (silver to ashes)|“🜁:🜠→🝗” (copper to ashes)|“🜁:🜜→🝗” (iron to ashes)] → opening the chest releases the fog which will transform any exposed metal of the indicated type to dust: armour, unsheathed weapons, rings, diadems, or bracelets worn, etc
1,**oil**: a small coal fire up above is heating a cauldron suspended on a metal rod just below the ceiling; a pressure plate turns the cauldron over → dousing everybody in boiling oil for 1d8 damage; a 2 in 6 chance for the fire falling into the oil and igniting it, causing another 1d8/rd for the next two rounds
1,**pendulum blade**: a vertical slit on both sides and on the ceiling; a pressure plate → roll an attack against the first person: 1d8 damage; anybody has a 4 in 6 chance of evading the pendulum’s attack
1,**rope trap**: straw covers the floor; sweeping the straw reveals the rope; a curtain hides a large stone on a rope above a small well → stepping on the trigger releases the stone, pulling the rope, ripping the victim off its feet and leaves it dangling above the well; loud crash of the stone attracts wandering monsters
1,**scorched pedestal with statue of [power] holding a [gem]**: fire magic detectable; statue’s hand with the gem is connected to the arm with a hinge → movement of the hand unleashes a <a class="spell" href="#fireball">fireball</a>, 5d6 damage to all in the room, save vs. explosions for half
1,**skunk chest**: [chest], musty smell if examined closely → booby-trapped with skunk oil spray; all present are odoriferous for the next 3 days, i.e. fail all Charisma checks, random encounters underground are doubled: roll 2d6 instead of 1d6
1,**smoke trap**: obscures visibility while attackers enter from another room
1,**spiked ball**: fixed to the ceiling; trip wire leads up to it → when released, save vs. breath or take 2d6 damage
1,**stagnant pool**: boat on the far side

1,Here lives the **goat herder** [human with portrait] ([shepherd stats]) from *[nearby village name]* while the place is not used.
1,The *[evil tribe]* tribe has settled the place, raising [mountain animals] and making their [mountain orc product]. [orcs] [mountain orc leader specialty] The settlement is [orc fort] [orc plans]

1,[tengu settlement] [road to Vanaheim]

;tengu settlement
1,A sheer cliff rises at the end of this valley, two or three thousand feet, perhaps. Somewhere in the upper third, giant petrified roots stretch out into the emptiness, and an ingenious people has used these structures to build a settlement. [2d12 tengus] [tengu guardian misgivings]<p>[vulture demon in a cave]
1,As you leave behind the trees, you notice piles of skulls every now and then. A closer look reveals both humanoid skulls and beaked ones. A thin trail leads up the mountain side and ends at a crevasse: hundreds of feet below, a small creek; and a hundred feet across, a tengu fort. [2d12 tengus] [tengu guardian misgivings]<p>[vulture demon in a cave]

;2d12 tengus

1,“You may pray at the shrine of our lord *Pazuzu*, but you must leave before nightfall.”
1,“This land is forbidden to those without wings. Turn back now before you force our hand.”
1,“In ancient times we swore to guard this mountain against all incursions. Leave peacefully and you shall not be harmed.”
1,“You have defiled the holy grounds of our people and only your blood can wash this sin away. Prepare to die.”
1,“Your skulls will make a suitable addition to the piles our ancestors have collected.”

;vulture demon in a cave
1,A barred gate engraved with [Vanaheim decoration] blocks the entrance into the mountain itself. [vulture demon bleeding]
1,Overlooking it all is a big vulture head made of stone. A climbing chain leads up to the beak where a tunnel opens. You can hear a low [whimpering|moaning|wailing], barely distinguishable from the blowing wind. [vulture demon bleeding]

;vulture demon bleeding
1,The tunnel leads to a cavern about 60ft high. The **vulture demon** *[with demon name]* is hanging from the ceiling, wrapped in iron chains ([vulture demon stats]). It has been cut and bled a thousand times. On the floor below is a silver chalice with which the steaming blood is collected, to be used for ritual magic. [vulture demon promise]
1,The tunnel leads to a cavern about 60ft high, illuminated by green fire burning in its centre. There, held in place by iron chains, writhes the **vulture demon** *[with demon name]*, forever regenerating ([vulture demon stats]). [vulture demon promise]

;vulture demon sacrifice
1,Atop the highest mountain here stands the ruin of an ancient temple to the five winds: a circle of sixty columns, each 100ft high. In the middle of this circle lies a stone block. The **vulture demon** *[with demon name]* has been nailed to it with silver spikes ([vulture demon stats]). [vulture demon promise]<p>[vulture demon guardian]
1,There is a crack in the mountain here, a narrow gorge lying in shadows with an icy wind blowing through it and a tumultuous river gnawing itself into the rock. At the far end is a waterfall from the snow fields above and under the water the **vulture demon** *[with demon name]* has been nailed to the rocks with silver spikes ([vulture demon stats]). [vulture demon promise]<p>[vulture demon guardian]
1,On the mountain peak you can see a gleaming needle, 20ft high. If you approach, you can hear the **vulture demon** *[with demon name]* [moaning and whimpering|howling] ([vulture demon stats]). It has been impaled here, since time immemorial, unable to die. [vulture demon promise]<p>[vulture demon guardian]

;vulture demon promise
1,It whispers, “Release me, fellow travellers! Release me now and I will grant you want your heart’s desires!”
1,It begs, “Please, release me! I was betrayed by my brothers and sisters. I do not deserve this!”
1,It whimpers, “Put and end to my suffering. Kill me now, I beg you!”
1,It moans incomprehensible words, its face contorted in pain.
1,It says, “Drink my blood, I shall grant you my strength and we shall be siblings. Together we will avenge this!”

;vulture demon guardian
1,The **invisible stalker** called *[invisible stalker name]* guards the demon ([invisible stalker stats]). It is a formidable hunter and prefers to attack with surprise. Stab first, make demands later – that is how it thinks. “I swore to guard this fiend for all eternity. Leave this place!”
1,The **jinni** called *[jinn name]* guards the demon ([jinn stats]). Before turning into a whirlwind, it warns you: “Do not touch this fiend, for I have sworn to keep it here for all eternity.” [vulture demon lore]
1,The **jinni** called *[jinn name]* guards the demon ([jinn stats]) with an illusion of corrupting black and green fire surrounding the demon. If anybody approaches, it shows itself as a flame spirit and warns you: “Do not approach or the corruption of this demon will transform you into hell maggots.” The demon disagrees, of course! “Don’t fall for this illusion! The flames are not real.”

;vulture demon lore
1,Apparently, *[same demon name]* is a traitor from the back in the days when the gods fought amongst themselves.
1,Apparently, *[same demon name]* is an agent of *Pazuzu*, a plague demon bent on destroying the world.
1,Apparently, the gods have bound agents of *Pazuzu* near gates to Vanaheim, as a warning to all.

;road to Vanaheim
1,<p>The passage to Vanaheim is sealed by the life blood of *[same demon name]*. If it is killed, the **vulture demons** *[and demon name]* and *[and demon name]* can *planeshift* here from Vanaheim, bent on avenging their sibling. If it is freed, it will try to kill as many of it’s enemies as it can, and then *planeshift* back to Vanaheim. For the trained eye, the foot passage is revealed: [a spidery network of silver veins in the rock|traces of red sand|whispering warm winds] lead the way towards a black [tunnel|crevice] in the rock face.<p>[road to Vanaheim obstacle]<p>[exit to Vanaheim]

;road to Vanaheim obstacle
1,You hear roaring thunder up ahead. The tunnel emerges on a storm swept mountain peak where the sky is boiling purple and lightning shows the **blue dragon** *[here blue dragon name as dragon name]*[dragon portrait] [flying|circling] up above ([blue dragon stats]). “Who dares trespass into my realm?” [dragon treasure] From here, the trail leads down into Vanaheim.
1,The tunnel leads into a crypt with countless life-like stone warriors, each with a noble face, carrying their polearm. At the centre of this petrified army: [1d4 spectres] ([spectre stats]), on a scythed war chariot pulled by 2 **nightmares** ([nightmare stats]) wielding a *life stealer bow* +1 (deals and extra 1d6 damage and heals the archer by the same amount). When approached, the chariot charges into its enemies: save vs. death or suffer 3d6 damage from the magic scythes. [ancient treasure] From here, the tunnel leads to Vanaheim.
1,You hear the a rumbling, a croaking, a bleating, animal voices… and then there is the stench of a hundred corpses. The tunnel leads to a mist filled cavern with visibility limited to 10ft. In the centre of the cavern is a 30ft. rock; stairs lead up to a temple decorated with [[power] decoration]. It is dedicated to [same power] and guarded by a **chimera** ([chimera stats]). [terror treasure] At the back, there is a long and narrow stair from the temple going up.

;exit to Vanaheim
1,Before you stretches a land of red rocks and dust, with green valleys cut into the surface. Down there, water flows and trees grow. Up on the red hillsides stand ancient castle and temple ruins, and countless burial mounds. The sun is about to set and the sky is turning dark purple. At night, wraiths roam the land: [1d6 wraiths] ([wraith stats]). It’s a long way to the safety of the nearest village. Clearing out a tomb is of course also an option. [dead treasure]
1,Before you stretches a land of red rocks and sand. The sky is pale pink. It promises to be a hot day. In the distance, on a red mountain surrounded by a forest of thorns, stands an ancient tower. This is *Sandstein*, the hall where *Pazuzu*, the demon lord of [pestilence|famine] and [disease|hunger] holds court. Countless [crows|vultures] circle above. On the dusty road ahead you can see a company of [Vanaheim soldiers] [Vanaheim soldiering]

1,Huge, grey stones have been connected by smooth grey walls, blocking off the valley. There is a grey tower and a massive gate in the wall.<p>[necropolis gate]<p>[grey tower]
1,A ten-foot-tall black iron fence blocks the way here. Some of the spikes at the top of the fence are adorned with skulls of humans and other humanoids.<p>[necropolis gate]<p>[grey tower]

;necropolis gate
1,The *gate* is large enough to admit a giant, made of wood and iron and decorated in bronze, held together by spells. The doors show a crowd of demonic faces, teeth, horns, claws, and bulging eyes.
1,The *gate* is a blackness of cold and despair. Anybody close to the gate feels their life drain away and as their body ages. Touch the gates drains and eventually kills you.
1,The *gate* is still humming with magical energies. Shimmering lines show penitentiaries humbly begging for entrance. If you knock on the gates with nothing but your clothes on, empty handed, no weapons, no armour, no metal, then it will slowly open for you and just for you. If anybody else tries to slip through, the doors will slam shut: save vs. death or be crushed.

;grey tower
1,[grey tower description]<p>[grey tower inside]<p>[grey tower top]

;grey tower description
1,Towering above the walls is a bulging *tower* with vertical slits serving as windows, like the visor of a fancy helmet.
1,Rising above the wall is a massive *tower* that suffered mightily under some heavy blows. It still stands but it is smashed open, the insides laid bare for all to see.
1,To the right of the gate stands a massive *tower* that had its top blown off. Over the years, this has allowed plants to gain a foothold. Bushes and grass grow from the top like green hair from a huge stone face.
1,Behind the wall there is a thin *spire*, impossibly high, with barely enough space for a staircase, or maybe ladders. It looks more like a mast with a crow’s nest at the top.

;grey tower inside
1,The wall and the tower are decorated with colourful banners but it’s hard to discern anything intelligible. Apparently anything that flutters in the wind gets used up here. [goblins]
1,The bellowing of horny hill giants can be heard far and wide. The walls and the tower are their love nest. [hill giants]
1,There are plenty of thick, wooden poles rising from the wall and sticking in the flanks of the tower. If the sun is up, you an see a crow-headed warriors jumping and shadow fighting up there: [1d12 tengu] Master *[same tengu name]* can [teach a fighter]
1,A bunch of ragged tents between wall and tower are the broken dreams of some desperate people. [bandits]
1,There is an improvised toll booth next to the tower and some tents further back. These people ask 50gp per head “to keep the area safe.” [bandits]
1,This is the realm of [stone giants] They are methodically moving cut stones the size of cattle, rebuilding the tower. They place a block, then move back and contemplate it's position for an hour, then repeat.

1,The top of the tower is inaccessible from the interior. A circus of [2d8] young **griffons** ([griffon stats]) is roosting up there when they’re not trying to impress each other with fantastic displays of aerial stunts. [maybe griffon eggs]
1,A stair leads up to the top of the tower but nobody ever takes it for up there the air is unnaturally cold and a half-transparent **spectre** is staring at the necropolis below. “Everyone I know has gone away, in the end.” All they are interested in is talking about the great armies they took to the [with direction] and to the [and direction], how they fought the armies of *[a wight capital]*, the manoeuvres they executed, the traps they set, the princes they had assassinated. This is *[a strange royal]*. Turning the conversation away from their achievements makes them very irate ([spectre stats]; *summon 1d4 servants* with the same stats). [ancient treasure]
1,At the top of the tower, through a painted arch and out onto a platform there is a throne, and on it sits the **spectre** *[a strange royal]*, desiccated and old, bones held together by leather straps and nails. They’re looking at the necropolis below. “This is my empire of dirt. You can have it all!” They butchered all their enemies. They rose in the ranks of *[an old wight leader]*. They held offices in *[a wight capital]*. Talking about the presence angers them ([spectre stats]; *summon 1d4 servants* with the same stats). [ancient treasure]

;necropolis central area
1,The necropolis itself consists of dozens of mausoleums, each built according to the same plan: a fake entrance leading to an altar where descendants left flowers and food for the dead, with paintings of their exploits and achievements, and a *hidden* entrance from above, sealed with a heavy drop stone, trapped by spiked pits below and crushing stones above, filled with poison dust or a brazier of *warp* blood resulting in terrible mutations. And finally, [1d8 mummies] patiently waiting for news from the world of the living ([mummy stats]). They want to know about the world outside but they are unwilling to part with any treasure they might have.
1,The necropolis itself is an endless graveyard, tombstone after tombstone, filling every slope in this valley, stone statues, inscriptions, pictures, headstones engraved with [Set decoration] or [Pazuzu decoration]. At night the ghosts rise from their graves, lamenting the state of their graves and the lack of care, the sloth of their descendants, and they curse them and their world, not realising that their world has already faded and that they are the only ones left. Appropriate rites and sacrifices, a purification and a hallowing might bring them peace.
1,This might have been a necropolis hundreds of years ago but now it’s more like a meadow. There are still some overgrown headstones to see, some mausoleums are still standing, some statues can be discerned, but most of it is pasture now, [mountain animals] grazing and a bunch of orcs working on their [mountain orc product]. The banners on their tents intents identify them as [evil tribe] orcs. [orcs] [mountain orc leader specialty]
1,The valley is filled with ruins. This must have been a large monastic complex in its heyday. These days the ceilings have fallen, walls have crumbled, weeds are growing everywhere and anything not made of stone has rotten away. It’s hard to say what these buildings were used for. Here you can see an engravings of [Pazuzu decoration], over there is an engraving of [Set decoration].
1,The necropolis turned to dust over the years and now nothing but a few statues and crumbled mausoleums remain. Amidst this decay stand newer huts made of wood and dried mud, covered in grass and decorated with banners of [with simple colour] and [and simple colour]. [6d6] **lizard people** ([lizard people stats]) live up here, led by *[lizard people name]* (HD [1d4+2 as level]). [leader treasure] The huts are guarded by [lizard companions].

;naga fortress
1,At the end of this valley the mountains rise up like a wall and on that wall is a giant *seven-headed snake* made of living stone, as if melted and reshaped by the strongest spells. In each of the seven heads there burns a magic fire. This is *[here snake place]*.<p>Down below, at the foot of the wall, there is [snake gate]
1,On the pass at the end of this valley there is a structure: *seven towers* growing out of the same rock, bending upwards into the sky, each ending in a snake head, maw wide open, each containing a hall with a brazier in which an eternal flame is burning. This is *[here snake place]*.<p>Down below, where the seven snake necks meet the steep trail leading up to the pass there is [snake gate]
1,Rectangular blocks of stone have been carefully stacked here forming *rounded domes* of various shapes and sizes. The domes are all clustered together giving the appearance they grew from this valley like anthills. This is *[here snake place]*.<p>One of the smaller domes has a pathway leading to it, flanked by [snake gate]
1,Near the top of this mountain, an eroded slope turns into a valley containing a clear lake in the center. On the shore of the lake, a worn *stone pyramid* echoes the shapes of the mountains. This is *[here snake place]*.<p>On the south-facing side, there is [snake gate]

;snake gate
1,a *gate of snakes*: a knot of two impossibly large stone snakes with a passage underneath illuminated by torches and guarded by [snake people]
1,a *maw of thorns*: a tunnel with a thousand inwards pointing needles several feet long and but a thin path winding its way through it. In front of the maw is a platform, facing south. It is much warmer here than one would expect this far up. [lizard people]
1,a *walkway* lined on either side by carved stone pillars, each shaped to give the appearance of an enormous snake wrapped around it, there opened mouths threatening those who pass. If you misstep, the snakes' mouths shoot **poison darts** at the unwary: save vs. poison or die.

;temple of Set
1,[here store Set as temple power][here store temple of [same temple power]]Once past the entrance, a tunnel winds itself up into the hollow sphere of the snake sanctum: the upper hemisphere is decorated with [with Set decoration] and [and Set decoration]. Above hangs a chandelier about 50ft wide beset with a thousand stones glowing in a warm light. It’s impossibly hot in here.<p>Ramps connect rows and rows of circular platforms leading down the lower hemisphere to the bottom of the sphere. One these platforms are the huts of [temple servants]<p>At the very bottom of the sphere is a ramp descending into the darkness below.
1,[here store Set as temple power][here store temple of [same temple power]]Inside, the central temple contains four bronze snake statues oriented towards the cardinal directions. Large red candles at the base of each statue give a flickering and smoky light. Each statue has a different colored gem set in its forehead (500gp each). The north wall contains a giant mural of [with Set decoration] and the floor is decorated with a mosaic of [and Set decoration].<p> Under the mural, a passage leads further north, past the quarters of [temple servants]<p>At the end of the hallway, stairs lead upwards.
1,[here store Set as temple power][here store temple of [same temple power]]The air inside the temple is surprisingly warm and damp. Lush green plants scramble over stairs and wrap around pools of steaming water. Hidden in the greenery, humans with patches of iridescent scales on their skin observe and wait, for now.

;lindwurm
1,Scorched tree stumps and puddles of poisonous [black|brown] bile are everywhere. The icy wind bites mercilessly. Rocks loom overhead as the valley floor reaches a maw, a blackness that leads into the bowels of the earth. This is is **lindwurm** territory ([lindwurm stats]). [terror treasure]<p>[lindwurm companions]

;lindwurm stats
1,HD 5 AC 4 2d6 F5 MV 24 ML 7 XP 500; *poisonous gas* surrounds it at all times: when within 30ft, save vs. poison or loose 1d6

;lindwurm companions
1,The tunnels *above* the lindwurm caverns are inhabited by [6d10] **goblins**, led by *[goblin name]* ([goblin stats]). [poor treasure] They will happily defend the lindwurm using their bows and arrows. If pursued, they will try and lure fools into the nets of 2d4 **giant spiders** ([giant spider stats]). There is a 2 in 6 chance that running leads people into a web trap. Anybody trapped is *helpless*.
1,The tunnels *below* the lindwurm caverns are inhabited by [1d8 trolls] ([troll stats]). [robber treasure]

;mountain orcs
1,The valley up here is hard to find. This is where the orcs of the *[evil tribe]* tribe raise [mountain animals] and make their [mountain orc product]. [orcs] [mountain orc leader specialty]<p>[mountain orc settlement]

;forge orcs
1,The ruin has been settled by the *[evil tribe]* tribe. This is where they study dwarven technology and build strange and wonderful machines from the wreckage, and this is where they cultivate their mushrooms to make [forge orc mushroom dish].<p>[orcs] [forge orc leader specialty]<p>[forge orc settlement]

You can see their clan insignia carved into the weathered knots of stone: [with dwarven equipment] and [and dwarven equipment]. The platform is still surrounded by columns, the raised blocks used as tables are still there but everything else is gone.<p>The underground storage rooms are being used by the **orcs** of the *[evil tribe]* tribe. They roam this valley, raising [mountain animals] and making their [mountain orc product]. [orcs]<p>[mountain orc leader specialty]

At night, wild howling can be heard.<p>[2d6] **werewolves** live here ([werewolf stats]). During the day, the place looks like a field lazaret with mauled humans lying on dirty rags. During the night, they succumb to their madness, slipping back into close quarter bunker fighting, never quite managing to kill each other for good. [poor treasure]
1,a blocky [stone mat] fortress, its great [iron|steel] gates bent, crushed, and broken, and covered in rust. An inner courtyard is littered with the bleached bones of dwarves, long stripped of their armor; only broken axes and chipped mattocks remain. [dungeon]
1,a [stone mat] citadel, its [iron|steel] gate impregnable, but next to it the charred, collapsed stones of the wall had exploded inward. [dwarven clan fame] Investigating and moving some of the rocks will reveal some of their quality [same dwarven equipment], unsullied by time.

#starting point for food and drink tables for menus/food items
#basic construction: tables for domestic/garden and wild food products
#sub-tables for specific types of veg/seasoning herbs/descriptions and preparation methods
#meat: I try to use the "food names" for animals here if they exist, hence the "meat quantifier" in the table names
#also doing cheese with some cheese producing animals and a few descriptors focusing on texture/type/flavor
#breads exists now, probably needs more options
#plurals are pretty common for things that are consumed in groups, there are a few singulars, but I don’t think they will create too much trouble.
#also imported berries (I prefer the prefix method for this), updated fruits
#still to do potentially: climate/terrain variations and adherence. These may require revising the tables, for now I’m just going to assume a handy trade network for produce/meat :)
#some recipes may not seem too appetizing thanks to the random generation, but there’s no accounting for local tastes :)

1,The tunnels is a vertical cave, going down for thousands of feet. If you can’t fly and rely on ropes to get you down safely, it takes a week of climbing.
1,Steep tunnels twist themselves into the bowels of the earth. There are sharp edges everywhere, but at least you can walk.
1,The tunnel passes through cavern after cavern on the way down. The tunnel walls are smooth and warm to the touch.
1,The passages leading down are small cracks and shafts, barely enough to squeeze through. The rocks are warm and the air is dry and hot.
1,Sulphur vapours make it hard to see far. Yellow mud cakes the walls and hot steam is bubbling in tiny cracks wherever you go.
1,Impossible as it seems, this passage seems to be dug into charred wood, as if bored by huge beetles into Yggdrasil itself.

;road to Muspelheim obstacle

1,The tunnel opens up into a cavern 100ft across and at the far end, the exit is guarded by a **pyrohydra** ([pyrohydra stats]). [terror treasure]

[luxurious context] [dwarven treasure] From the lower gate, the tunnel continues towards Muspelheim.
1,The tunnel opens up into a huge vertical shaft, disappearing into darkness above and ending in a bubbling lava lake at the bottom. Narrow stairs lead down to the lake.

;exit to Muspelheim
1,Eventually, you feel a light draught and then at last, there’s light: the tunnel opens up into a steep valley dug by a lava river. The sky above you is black but there are lava falls on all sides, pouring into the river. A trail turns [left|right] and leads you up to a giant building on a cliff overlooking the valley of fire.<p>[store lava as liquid][fire giant building]
0,The tunnel ends at a huge iron gate. There’s a [hammer on a chain|a big ring] fastened to the gate, a kind of knocker.

If killed, the elf will soon reincarnate as another lion and return.

1,This is a temple of [here fire power as temple power][here store temple of [same temple power]]. The huge [fire material] gates are decorated with [[same fire power] decoration]. [fire giant ground floor]<p>[fire giant temple of [same fire power]] [fire giant temple interior]<p>[1d4 fire giants]

;fire giant temple of Pazuzu
1,At the entrance of the temple stands the statue of a four-winged vulture demon made of [fire material].
1,Above the entrance is the statue of a giant vulture demon feeding on the entrails of a monstrous creature that are in the process of turning into dragons and snakes.
1,The temple looks like it is but a heap of dead bodies made of stone. Everywhere are hands, feet, faces, bones.

;fire giant temple of Hel
1,The entrance to the temple is shrouded in magical darkness. Inside the blackness is the guardian of this temple, a **three-headed giant hell-hound** named *[cerberus name]* ([cerberus stats]).
1,The path leading up to the temple passes beneath two rows of giant [fire material] ribs rising 50ft into the air.

;fire giant temple of Mitra
1,Above the main portal into the temple are the statues of three giants with solemn faces, their hands raised for their oath of allegiance.
1,To the left and right of the entrance are two giant braziers, 20ft in diameter, burning with a magical fire.

;fire giant temple of Marduk
1,The front of the temple consists of a sea of sculptures: a thousand stone soldiers, staring out at any visitors, wielding their [swords|spears|halbers], waiting for a battle that never comes.
1,Above the entrance to this temple you see a giant chariot. Inside it are an archer and a driver. Giant scythes project out from the wheels to cut down soldiers that oppose them.

;fire giant temple interior
1,The inside of this temple is a domed chamber nearly 100ft high. There are stone benches sit on and [fire material] statues of fire giants to look at. If you know the legends you can see the statues of [fire giant statues].
1,The inside of the temple is dizzying array of platforms connected by short stairs, with [fire material] trees burning under a roof 60ft above. Along the walls are rows of statues. If you know the history of dwarves and giants, you’ll recognise the statues of [fire giant statues].
1,The inside of this temple might at one time have been glorious but now it is filled with boiling grey mud and dancing shadows. The fires burning along the walls show fallen statues and broken columns disappearing the blubbering mass. The stink of sulphur hangs in the air.

1,the **red dragon** *[here red dragon name as dragon name]*[dragon portrait] ([red dragon stats])

;fire giant courtyard
1,The stones and walls of this courtyard are glowing red. Anything touching them will start to burn if combustible.
1,The walls surrounding the courtyard are decorated with long black iron spikes, needles as long as a man or two, pointing up, in order to discourage flying opponents from landing.
1,The courtyard itself encloses a lava-filled pit crossed by a bridge made of [fire material].

;fire giant reception
1,At the foot of the fortress are some workshops. This is where blackened  [3d8] **dwarves** ([dwarf stats]) slave at the anvils and bellows led by [dwarf with portrait] (level [1d4+2 as level]). They are chained to their workstations, their bedrolls right next to their tools. The food and water they require is stored inside the fortress, behind locked doors in [fire material] coffers.
1,At the foot of the fortress is a hot pool of [same liquid] where orange worm people can be seen: [2d4] **salamanders** led by *[salamander name]* ([salamander stats]) live here.

;fire giant top floor
1,The top of the fortress is a big room with a throne surrounded by many giant statues. These are the personifications of *[with fire person]* and *[and fire person]*. [1d4 fire giants]
1,The fortress looks like a [fire material] pitchfork. Each of the three needles is a sequence of ladders and small rooms, spiral stairs, with narrow windows and tiny balconies. Dozens of iron grates, scythe blades and spiked pits make progress painfully slow. [1d4 fire giants]
1,The fortress looks like a [fire material] candelabrum with [three|four|five] branches, each ending in a large study, surrounded by a round platform, overlooking the cavern. Each platform has stacks of heavy stone disks, the kind the giants know how to throw for devastating effect. [1d4 fire giants]
1,Up above, the conical tower of [fire material] is covered in long spikes and thorns, each of them as long as a man or longer. This is a formidable defence against the landing of dragons and other air borne enemies. Narrow widows allow the inhabitants to control the surrounding land without exposing themselves. [1d4 fire giants]
1,The fortress grows out of a rocky outcrop like a scrawny tree, with lava tunnels leading up to the [fire material] tower like intestines twisting this way and that way, leading into larger rooms full of strange machinery, perfect for an ambush by the [5d8] **duergar** in the service of these giants ([duergar stats]). The tower itself is small in comparison. [1d4 fire giants]

# These are the monsters for larger villages
;trees
1,This is the [forest name]. [signs of human activity]<p>[a monster threatening the village]

;signs of human activity
1,Tall trees cover this valley. Occasionally, you can see tree stumps so somebody must be logging these trees.
1,There are many trails made by loggers, wood gatherers and swine herders leading to a village.
1,The trees along the trails through this forest have all been coppiced, i.e. cut down near the ground level in order to produce wood.
1,The lack of branches and trees lying on the forest floor is a sign of regular wood gatherers.
1,Within the forest are a few clearings with small cherry and plum tree orchards.
1,Within the forest are a few clearings with small apple tree orchards.
1,There is a clearing in this forest where [an old statue] of *[power]* still stands.

;a monster threatening the village
1,You shouldn’t stray too far from the trails because this forest has been cursed by the presence of [2d4] **harpies** ([harpy stats]) luring men into the depths of the forest and to their death with their magical singing. [terror treasure]
1,Deep in the forest there is a cave where the **ettin** *[ettin name]* lives ([ettin stats]). It is known for its fury and its appetite for human flesh. Luckily, it fears [horses|archers|armoured fighters|groups of more than a handful of people] and the locals have adapted. [robber treasure]
1,Hiding between the trees are the watchful eyes of [1d12 bugbears] ([bugbear stats]). [scout treasure] Bugbears are usually a bad sign for they are often employed as spies by the elves of the netherworld. These carry amulets of passage bearing the [name for a clan of the netherworld elves] sigil.
1,The camp of [1d12 bugbears] is hard to find ([bugbear stats]). [scout treasure] They hunt these woods at night and like to kill anybody that didn’t make it back to the village during daytime.
1,[orcs] They keep a low profile, living deep in the forest, but lone travellers, or fools that don’t make it back to the village before sunset, or reckless idiots looking for trouble, they’ll all find the orcs to be more than willing to kill.

;ettercap ground level
1,Spider webs between the trees make progress impossible. Desiccated deer and birds hang in these nets. Touching these nets or setting them on fire attracts [2d4] **giant spiders** ([giant spider stats]).
1,Between the gnarled roots of giant [tree] trees you see the opening of burrows large enough to be bear dens (at least [2d4] of them). If anybody passes within 20ft of such a hole, a **giant tarantula** ([giant spider stats]; *surprise* on 1–5 in 6) jumps out of the burrow and attacks. When the fighting begins, the remaining spiders are attracted by the stomping.
1,The ground rises and forms a little mound here, promising a look at the surrounding land. But actually, a group of [2d4] **giant trapdoor spiders** ([giant spider stats]) have dug tunnels and pits around here. Anybody climbing the mound has a 1-2 in 6 chance of sliding and falling into a 20ft pit (2d6) and being beset by these spiders.

;ettercap lake
1,The trees of [forest name] open up and there’s a small island up ahead, covered in giant trees shrouded in spiderwebs. There are dessicated birds and bats and bigger things (wyverns, young dragons, griffons?) caught in the web up there. If you’re patient, you can see movement beneath the water as giant spiders dart out of their silken diving bells to kill fish. [2d4] **giant diving bell spiders** ([giant spider stats]; *swim*) live in this lake. It is not safe for swimming.
1,The trees of [forest name] open up and there’s a small island up ahead. Big silken strands connect the giant trees growing on that island with the trees growing along the lake’s edge. From it, smaller strands hang down, filling the air and sinking into the water. During the day, you can see [2d4] **giant spiders** working these strange fishing lines ([giant spider stats]).
1,The trees of [forest name] open up and there’s a small island up ahead. Giant trees grow on that island. A sweet, musky flagrance of wisteria and roses fills the air. On these trees [2d4] **giant bolas spiders** hunt for prey ([giant spider stats]; *bola*: 30ft ranged attacks with a weighted *capture blob* of sticky silk on a line).

;ettercap lair
1,Up in the trees are some tree houses connected by several ropes. If you’re not afraid of heights, you can easily walk from one to the other, feet on one rope and hands holding another one. The tree houses are home to [2d4] **ettercaps** led by [ettercap with portrait] ([ettercap stats]). [average treasure] [ettercap prisoners]
1,Up ahead is a rocky outcrop, about 100ft high, wrapped in spider webs. In the cracks of this rock live [2d4] **ettercaps** led by [ettercap with portrait] ([ettercap stats]). [average treasure] [ettercap prisoners]

;elf environment
1,The settlement is nearly impossible to spot from the ground level.
1,At night, the settlement is illuminated by magic light.
1,During the day, sweet music can be heard from the tree tops.
1,Dangling upside-down from the larger branches of the [tree] trees is a small colony of [1d6+1] **giant bats** ([giant bat stats]). They are easily disturbed and once awake their cries surely alert the elves.
1,The settlement thrives in symbiosis with a hive of [1d6+1] **giant bees** ([giant beetle stats]).
1,Patrolling the leaf litter, is a small pack of [1d2+1] **blink dogs** guarding the elves to repay an ancient debt ([wolf stats]; *intelligent*; *blinking*: can only be hit on an *even* roll of the d20).
1,As agile and silent in the branches as they are on the forest floor, the settlements perimeters are patrolled by [1d2+1] **giant ocelots** ([jaguar stats]).
1,Installed strategically throughout the settlement are [1d2+1], mostly stationary **wood golem archers** ([wood golem stats]). Each can instantaneously sprout new arrows from their ligneous bodies.
# for reference see here: https://www.flickr.com/photos/waldopepper/46335454624/
1,Sentinels in the skies above and surprisingly agile fliers, [1d2+1] **griffons** ([griffon stats]) are fully capable of narrow dives through the leafy canopy and navigating the branches and boughs of the [tree] trees.
1,A parliament of [1d4+1] **giant owls** ([owl stats]) nests nearby and will defend their elven friends to the death.
# 1,A single, small **roc** can sometimes be seen scouting above.
# giant eagles/birds of prey seem to fit with elves, but larger versions of smaller birds (like Butcher Birds, Kingfishers, and Jays could be neat)
1,Gifted with effective camouflage that conceals as they cling to the larger [tree] trunks, [1d4+1] **giant geckos** watch for any trespassers ([giant lizard stats]).
1,Typically found lounging on larger [tree] branches and blending in with the massive vines are [1d6+1] **giant pythons**, trained to immobilise any interlopers ([giant snake stats]). They only kill their victims if others continue attacking them.
1,A bloom of [3d6] **sprites** are never far from this settlement and can often serve as an early warning system by delaying any intruders with their pranks and mischief ([sprite stats]).
1,Ancient guardians from a forgotten time, [1d2+1] **crystal living statues** stand silent guard over the settlement ([stone golem stats]).
1,The very trees themselves often leap to the settlement’s defense thanks to the efforts of [1d2+1] befriendet **treants** ([treant stats]).
1,The settlement has cultivated deliberate gardens of **shrieking fungus** whose piercing cries are quick to alert them of any invaders.
1,Throughout the leaf litter are innocuous looking **puffball mushrooms** that, if inadvertently pierced or damaged emit clouds of slumber spores.
1,The elves have chosen this site well, for [1d3+1] of their tree-homes are inhabited by **dryads** whose beguiling magics often transforms potential foe to fast friend ([dryad stats]).
1,Scores of innocuous **song birds** are quick to betray the presence of any infiltrators with their loud, screeching warning songs.
1,The air is filled the sweet, intoxicating fragrance of *honeysuckle* vines that weave throughout the branches and bushes.
1,It’s easy to feel watched in this part of the wood, as every [tree] tree trunk features a stern looking **face**.
1,There are quite a few skeletons lying under the trees. The reason being the lush brambles here concealing blood-sucking **vampiric vines**: If you make camp, save vs. spells or die overnight as they immobilise you and suck you dry.
1,Touching any tree here without whispering the secret elven words of soothing is not advised, as one could be stuck fast by the quick flowing, impossibly **sticky sap**.

# requires [a war party] and a [captain]
1,[here store captain *[same captain]* was last seen in *[same village name]* carrying the banner of *[the war party]* as war fact]

;the presence of mercenaries is a problem
1,For now, *[same captain]* has forced the mercenaries to pay for all the food but the locals feel like they’re forced to sell their winter stores and once the mercenaries are gone and winter comes, what then?
1,The town is in uproar. Young *[human name]* has been found dead. They want to see the soldier hanged. Clearly, *[same captain]* is weak and discipline is slipping: it’s only a matter of time until the mercenaries take matters into their own hands.
1,The town is in uproar. Young *[human name]* has been assaulted and they want to see the soldier hanged. A delegation is speaking to *[same captain]* right now.
1,The town appears very quiet. People are keeping to their homes, afraid of what the mercenaries might do. *[same captain]* needs supplies, however, and if they’re not selling eventually they will have to take them.
1,Already the mercenaries are drinking far too much. The locals grind their teeth and clench their fists when they hear the insults and sneers of the drunken mercenaries but they know all too well that now is not the time to fight back.
1,*[same captain]* is recruiting, promising a gold piece per day while on campaign, and a share of the loot! The young and gullible are already falling for it. You can see the beardless faces of *[human name]*, *[human name]*, and *[human name]* amongst the tents. And you can see some elderly people crying outside the captain’s tent. “[We beg you|Please|Have mercy]! We need the [young ones|youngsters|children] to work the fields! Don’t take them off to war!”
1,*[same captain]* had trouble filling the ranks and so now they’re terrorising the locals, forcing them to give up their young ones: they offer to pay their parents’ debts, they’re claiming that they lost a gamble about it last night, they’re threatening to burn down their farm if they don’t come. These are the sullen faces of *[human name]*, *[human name]*, and *[human name]* in the camp.

;the presence of refugees is a problem
# no captain!
1,As the wounded start dying, the stench is spreading. Flies are everywhere. Soon, cholera and typhus will be showing up. The locals want the refugees gone, but who is going to argue with armed men? Better to stab them during the night, some might say.
1,The locals are no longer willing to support the refugees, calling them maggots and worms and worse. Nobody is willing to kill, however, and so the situation just lingers, the refugees too weak to kill the locals and simply take what they need and the locals to afraid to do away with the extra mouths.
1,The young **[human class]** *[human with portrait]* is a devout servant of *[good power]*. They are trying to find a solution to the problem. Surely some land could be cleared for these poor souls? Let them settle.
1,The young **[human class]** *[human with portrait]* is a devout servant of *[evil power]*. They have shrewdly insinuated that the locals are simply waiting for them to weaken even further until one night they’ll all just stab them. So why not take things into your own hands and act first? Strike now and take what you need!

;the presence of corpses is a problem
# no captain!
1,The many corpses have attracted the **necromancer** [human with portrait][here store [same human name] as alchemist patron] (level [1d3+4 as level]). This does not sit well with the locals. Somebody should get rid of them! [spellbook for necromancers] [leader treasure for magic user] Their large tent is black and ominous. Inside, beautiful carpets cover the floor. It is guarded by [necromancer companions].
1,The many corpses are poisoning the air. The stink is horrendous. Flies are everywhere. The water is foul. *Ghoul fever* is spreading: *[human name]* and their family have turned into [1d4+2] **ghouls** roaming the graveyard at night, looking for some sweet, sweet human flesh.
1,The many corpses are poisoning the air. The stink is horrendous. Flies are everywhere. Some people say that the corpses move at night and indeed, *[human name]* has risen as a **wight** ([wight stats]). If the mess isn’t cleaned up there will be more, soon.

1,Although the area it grows in seems inordinately peaceful, *giant trapdoor spiders* often lair near places where *[same magic plant]* is found.

1,but now that I have mastered the technique I realise that I have no home to return to.
1,but they refused me, saying that I lacked experience. So I’m looking to kick ass and take some names.
1,but I was expelled for lack of discipline and my love of beer. So here I am, looking for work.

1,A prized **[circus exotic animal]** ([[same circus exotic animal] stats]) has escaped from their cage. [secret circus leader] is desperate and will pay 200gp to retrieve them, alive and intact.
1,Local children from *[nearby village name]* have gone missing, and many of them ran away to join *[same circus name]*. The villagers may not have much in the way of payment, but returning them would make you local heroes, and always welcome.
1,*[human with portrait]*, one of the [circus performers] that travels with the *[same circus name]* is secretely a **vampire** ([vampire stats]), with a coffin of dark earth hidden away in one of the [conveyances]. They use the nomadic nature of the [same circus2] to drain victims dry and move on before suspicion falls on the circus.
1,The circus has been experiencing mysterious accidents lately. Just yesterday, *[human with portrait]*, one of the [circus performers], was severely injured during their act. The other performers suspect foul play, but are too busy rehearsing to properly investigate. [circus plot]
1,On their last visit to *[nearby village name]*, the circus managed to bilk the community out of most of their wealth. [1d4x10] villagers armed with pitchforks and torches led by *[human with portrait]* has been tracking them down to forcibly request refunds.
1,Times have been tough for *[same circus name]* lately, and the last performance resulted in their payment being in the form of [with trade goods] and [and trade goods], *[human with portrait]* is looking to unload them for coin.
1,The [with circus performers] have gone on strike for better wages and more safety measures. The protest has begun to escalate, roping in the [and circus performers] and [and circus performers]. The days of ringmaster *[human with portrait]* may be numbered as [secret circus leader] and her supporters *[with human name]* and *[and human name]* are outmanoeuvring them.
1,The [secret circus leader] is looking to retire and settle down in *[nearby village name]*. They’ve saved up quite a bit of coin over the years, but ringmaster *[human with portrait]* is worried that they may end up taking the [with circus performers] *[with human name]* and *[and human name]* and [and circus performers] *[and human name]* and *[and human name]* with them.
1,A horrible accident occurred during the last [sideshow attractions] performance, and [secret circus leader] will pay 50gp for a new, exciting act for tonight’s show, and another 50gp for the same show in *[nearby village name]*.
1,The mascot of *[same circus name]*, the [domestic animal adjective] **[circus exotic animal]** has died. The [secret circus leader] suspects foul play and is quick to blame the [circus performers] *[with human name]* and *[and human name]* who have been getting significantly less ring-time lately.

;circus plot
1,Indeed, the [circus performers] *[with human name]* and *[and human name]* are actually **doppelgängers** ([doppelgänger stats]). They studiously avoid any contact with alcohol in order to avoid discovery.
1,Sadly, when they fired one of the [circus performers] back in *[nearby village name]*, *[human name]* swore bloody vengeance and started following the circus, sneaking through the camp at night and sabotaging the equipment.
1,It turns out that this all started after the breakup between the [circus performers] *[with human name as a]* and *[and human name as b]* back in [nearby village name]. *[same b]* has been acting strangely ever since, losing their temper easily and secretly threatening *[same a]* with more accidents unless they come back. *[same a]* isn’t confiding in anybody because they think *[same b]* can still be saved. But how?

1,Heavy rains have caused the banks of [name for river] to swell dramatically. The high-water line is up to the waist of an Ogre on the sides of buildings, and villagers are still shoveling mud out of their homes.
1,A flash flood caught the community by surprise recently. Several buildings were ripped from their foundations and deposited a good distance away. Several are still missing, including *[same human name]*.
1,The [food veg] crop that locals depend on for their livelihood is rotting in the fields. The ground is over saturated from recent rains, and the farmers curse the grey clouds.
1,Standing water still shimmers in large pools in the low areas throughout the village. It's grown brackish and is filled to the brim with mosquito larvae. Soon the dreaded *[diseases]*, carried on buzzing wings, will be a grave concern.

#possibly merge a fetch quest here for cures from the Herb/Plant tables or get Nergal followers involved :)
;plague
1,The doors and windows of a group of homes are boarded up and painted with superstitious symbols and charms. Anyone will tell visitors that a recent outbreak of *[diseases]* is to blame. Highly contagious, quarantine is the only cure the village folk know.
1,The **healer** [human with portrait] is at their wits end. They've never seen *[diseases]* spread so swiftly. Worry turns to terror when they also begin displaying symptoms.
1,Having lost a quarter of their number to *[diseases]* the villagers are growing more desperate and paranoid. Most carry fragrant pouches of dried *[magic plant]* that they constantly sniff and a few have even fled to the surrounding wilderness out of fear of infection.
1,Long ditches are being dug by weeping townsfolk, while all spare lumber is being gathered for a massive pyre. The numerous corpses of victims of *[diseases]* must be dealt with quickly, before it spreads further.

;famine
1,The soil here has been devastated by over-farming. The [with food veg], [and food veg], and [and food veg] that the settlement depends on are no longer growing, and there will be lean times ahead.
1,The village stores are down to their last bushel of rotting [food veg]. They began rationing long ago, and already have long since slain any [livestock]. Anyone can see the hollow, gnawing pain of hunger in every set of eyes.
1,Children rush toward any visitors with hands outstretched, most are too weak to mutter anything but “food… !” For the third year in a row, blight struck the [food veg] crop, and everyone has grown desperate as bellies growl and grumble.
1,The curse of vindictive *[nearby druid]* causes seeds to no longer sprout in the soil and fruit rots before it fully ripens. Driven to desperation and delirium by hunger, the locals like to pretend that their boiled boot leather is actually a local delicacy: “[dish]!”

;drought
1,Hearts leap at the sight of any clouds, but no rain is forthcoming. For almost the entire season it's been dry, and the [food veg] are turning brown in the fields.
1,The lack of rain wouldn't be so bad, had the well not gone dry. The brittle, brown grasses aren't good for grazing, and ribs are beginning to show on the [livestock].
1,Parched, cracked earth in the furrowed fields may yield easily to the plow, but the first rains of the season are late by months. The farmers have begun to worry that it will soon be too late to plant the [with food veg] and [and food veg].
1,Even the eldest member of the community, *Old [old name]* can't remember a time when water was so scarce. The [two or three] abnormally dry seasons in a row have everyone on edge, and the locals are contemplating making a deal with *[nearby witch]* to call forth the rains again with her magic.

;locusts
1,It was only a few days ago that the sky darkened completely as millions upon millions of **[titlecase green synonym] locusts** descended on the crops. Not a single row of [with food veg] or [and food veg] remained intact from their voracious appetite.
1,What first started as just a few stray and inoffensive **[titlecase yellow synonym] grasshoppers** in the beaks of hungry chickens soon became a plague. If one listens closely, one can even hear the hordes chewing. They've completely decimated the [with food veg] and [and food veg], and will soon move on to the [and food veg]. The farmers are at their wits end.
1,When *Old Lady [strange name for women]* was [witch execution] last week, the locals thought their troubles were over. Few paid any mind to the curses she spat out shortly before she died. Now impossible swarms of **[titlecase red synonym] locusts** seem to scream her name as they ravenously devour every leaf, stalk, and bud in the farmer's fields.
1,Far less numerous than their normal-sized counterparts, but just as devastating, a plague of **[1d12+1] dire locusts** [dire locust stats] have been spotted in the [food veg] fields and have even managed to devour a few [livestock]. The desperate settlement will pay 50gp for each one slain.

1,[holiday event]

;harvest event
1,Judging is underway for a prize-winning [with food veg] contest, including some of the largest [and food veg] you've ever seen: fit for a giant's table.
1,Inexplicably clement weather has led to a bumper crop of [with food veg], the villagers are practically giving it away by the bushel-full.
1,Whilst plowing their fields with their [domestic animal adjective] [draft animals], farmers uncovered a cache of ancient coins: [3d100] gold pieces have been equitably split within the community. Each is emblazoned with on one side with a forgotten queen and a mysterious tower on the other.
1,The [food veg] are growing exceptionally tall this year. Locals have discovered that clumps of medicinal herb *[magic plant]s* are thriving. This is one of the few non-magical cures for the horrid *[diseases]* and the villagers have made a tidy profit selling it off to visitors and travelling alchemists.
1,Visitors hear only laughter as [conveyances] groan and occasionally break under the weight of a record-breaking harvest of [food veg]. Since armies march on their stomach, [a war party]*[the war party]*'s agents have already indicated that their quartermasters intends to buy all of their surplus.
1,With [fruit]s ripening in abundance, the townsfolk have distilled a new tasty and potent spirit. This *[same fruit] [distilled beverage]* is quite delicious and already they are in trade-talks with the **dwarf** [dwarf with portrait], who plans to sell it in *[nearby village name]* ([dwarf stats]). “Will you travel with me?”

;animal event
1,Local [food veg] farmer *[human name]* couldn't believe their luck when every one of their [livestock] gave birth to healthy triplets this year.
1,Seen as an omen of good fortune, a [baby livestock] was born as white as the purest snow with a birthmark that eerily resembles [[good power] decoration]. Sacred to [same good power], the animal seems to be able to *[sacred ability]*.
1,The unruly geese tended to by the locals have recently been laying quite the surprise. Every few clutches contains a golden egg worth 25gp. As of yet, no one has held onto one long enough to see what hatches from them.
1,The old herder *[human name]* was distraught when one of their favorite [livestock] wandered off. When they finally tracked the beast down, it was found munching on a patch of valuable *[here magic plant]*.
1,The settlement was recently spared from a **[bandit|bugbear|goblin|orc]** raid due to a stampede of brave [livestock]. Herders have already begun breeding them for their fearlessness.

;holiday event
1,It is the festival of *Saint [old names for women]*, celebrated throughout the land for her miraculous ability to *[sacred ability]*. For the duration of the festival, all visitors are treated to a free meal of [rural meat prep] [food meat] [seasoning method] [with food seasonings] and as much [fruit] [distilled beverage] as they can drink.
1,From sunrise to sunset, the villagers here celebrate an ancient *Naming Festival*. Anyone whose name begins with the letter *[with random letter]* is treated royally and bedecked with flower wreaths, while anyone whose name begins with *[and random letter]* is playfully chastised and teased. It's also considered highly lucky for babies to be named by a visiting stranger on this day.
1,Today marks the birth of a hero: *[an old hero]* is rumored to hail from these parts. Friendly competitions (foot races, weight-lifting) may be hard to pass up, for the prize is a [a gem] encrusted [metal jewelry singular] (worth [3d6]00gp).

;small tower
1,The tower is four stories high and has an entrance on the second level. A ladder leads up to it. Twenty large stones are stored on the roof. This should be enough to deter a peasant uprising.
1,The massive round tower is three stories high and topped with a wooden section that feels like a comfortable tree house in peace time. The walls are thick and the main doors are reinforced with iron bands.

;small keep
1,The keep consists of a square tower three stories high, a stable, a kennel, and a little courtyard enclosed by a strong wall. Inside the wall is a wooden walkway that allows guards to look over the wall and shoot anybody approaching.
1,The keep consists of a gatehouse protecting the small courtyard and a square tower four stories high.

;small manor house
1,The manor house is a two story building made of stone, with no windows on the ground floor and small, arrow slits above, and a terrace up on the roof from which the surrounding land can be surveyed.
1,The manor house is connected to a walled courtyard with stables, barns and everything a rich land lord needs.

;small temple dedicated to Set
1,[small temple]
1,The temple is nothing but a pit in the earth with a stone ceiling and the statue of a giant snake in the back. In front of the snake there are burning candles and wooden poles with strings attached and at the end of every string is an accusation: names of villagers and their misdeed, the punishment requested, and counter claims, and peace offerings. This is where the elders decide upon blood money to be paid and punishments to be exacted.
1,Between some rocks, a crack leads deeper into the earth and into a cave. There, a giant snake made of stone watches over all who pray to *Set*. A deep pit contains the polished bones of all who where killed in revenge for their misdeeds. There are always wooden accusation plates to be found naming bandits, thieves, murders, adulterers, and cowards who ran from a battle, deserting their village comrades. Will you take a plate and exact revenge in the name of *Set*?
1,An old stairway leads into the bowels of the earth where warm vapours make your head swim. Down here, the **spirit naga** *[naga name]* will guide your hand, should you need her words ([naga stats]; <span class="treasure">a *naga tongue* is worth 1000gp to an alchemist</span>[here store naga tongue as alchemist quest]). Spend an hour down here and any soul dedicated to *Set* will tell you of the past and the future, for all time goes in circles and the big snake eats itself.
1,Deep below, where the **spirit naga** *[naga name]* guards the passages to Myrkheim ([naga stats]; <span class="treasure">a *naga tongue* is worth 1000gp to an alchemist</span>[here store naga tongue as alchemist quest]), pools of Earth Blood corrupt both the living and the dead. If you spend an hour here, your death warrant is sealed: slowly, you will die, or turn into an ettin, or a goblin, or some other dreadful creature.
1,This is a snake pit, a breeding ground for [1d4 giant snakes] and [1d8 snakes], a place dangerous to every warm blooded creature. And yet, the terror of these snakes also keeps bandits at bay and no orc will set foot near this place, such is the power of *Set*. They say that those with the secret knowledge can use snake poison to poison their blades and they say that all who serve the temple have done just that.
1,The temple is a school for assassins. This is where you learn to sneak, to lie, to conceal, to poison, to stab, to strangle. Students learn the secrets of the garrote, of the hidden blade and of the crossbow. All of this is known and yet the farce continues: this is where the young ones learn discipline and strength, diligence and respect. It’s a way to put food on the table, and it’s a useful skill to have available if you’re trying to get ahead.

1,The temple is a simple mausoleum with a bone pit. The poor and foreign folks are brought here upon their death for it is said that in the hour of need the dead will rise and fight for us at the End of the World.
1,The temple is an underground network of crypts with dozens of bone chambers. The bones of the dead are used walls, floor, and ceiling. They say that the Bone Road of the underworld is similarly made of all the bones of the restless dead. There they await the End of the World. The bone chambers are there to remind us that everything must pass.
1,The temple is an underground labyrinth of tunnels with dozens of niches where warriors of old await the end of the world. Most of them are truly dead except for [1d8 mummies] ([mummy stats]). Down here in the cold darkness, somebody is always eager to whisper words of wisdom in exchange for gold and jewels intent on corrupting the world above. It is the hope for eternal life, of resurrection in this world, which brings people back again and again. [dead treasure]
1,Beneath the town, after descending into an old chamber via many stairs, is the temple: a black pit where the broken whispers of [1d8 wights] can be heard ([wight stats]). Down there are the tunnels of madness. Behind the pit is a statue of a naked man, fat and hairy, with the horns of a giant ram, served by satyrs and skeletons. This is the trickster demon lord, the only one capable of bringing back souls from the afterlife, or so they say. [dead treasure]
1,The temple is a burial mound with various secret crypts, each sealed and secured. Falling rocks, swinging blades, spiked pits, and hidden spears await the fools intent on disturbing the draugar, the restless dead, champions of old, warriors and sorcerers all, awakened and animated by the Earth Blood, waiting for their signal. When Fenrir devours the sun, the undead will smash their prison gates and it will be the end of all that is good.

1,The temple houses a traditional reed boat. This symbolizes the passage into the netherworld. Inscriptions on the wall describe sickness and death as the transition from the world of the living into the realm of *Nergal*. Behind the temple is the graveyard.
1,The temple is a school of exorcism. All the dead belong to *Nergal* and to animate the dead is theft. The temple specialises in the finding and killing of [undead].
1,The temple used to be a hospice but now most of the building is abandoned and sealed. Should the seal be broken, sickness and death awaits any trespassers. Poisonous molds. Deadly gases. Rotting diseases and blindness. The plague will return.
1,The temple is a big feasting hall and a meeting place for the sisters and brothers of the hunt. They hunt vampires wherever they go and thus they all carry magical blades. Beneath the hall are fortified sleeping quarters. This is where the elders lock themselves away when the moon is full for they are all **werewolves** ([werewolf stats]).
1,The temple is an asylum for the demented and the old. Everything is quiet. [3d6] **old people** sit there, staring at you, unblinking. Their caretaker is *[human name]* ([human stats]). *Nergal* wants the living to forget the dead and the process starts right here, right now.

;small temple dedicated to Pazuzu
1,[small temple]
1,The temple is built like the aerie of a giant vulture into a cliff. A narrow stair winds itself through the rock from the base up 100ft to this nest. There, a stone vulture watches the buildings below. A great many small dolls adorn the shelves at the back. These are all the lost children.
1,The temple is a four storied windowless square tower. Inside a set of ladders leads to the roof. There’s a lift with which to raise corpses to the roof. The roof itself is covered in broken bones. This is where the sky burial takes place. Meat boys and bone girls cut up the corpses and offer the remains of the dead to the vultures of *Pazuzu*.
1,The temple stands right next to hanging tree. There must be at least a hundred crows here. They say *Pazuzu* sees everything the crows see and thus the local priests are feared and everything that’s secret has to happen in the dark of night.
1,The temple stands on a rock needle about 100ft high with a rickety sequence of ladders leading up there. The four-winged statue of the crow demon *Pazuzu* is hard to see in all the smoke produced by smoldering fires in iron pots hanging in all four corners of the temple. The temple is looked after by [1d6 tengus].
1,The temple stands on a large rock about 20ft above the ground. Petitioners have to climb a rope hanging down over the edge. The temple also houses the **vulture demon** *[demon name]* ([vulture demon stats])
1,The temple is a a roofed platform made of wood built on top of a large rock about 20ft high. The platform has been blasted by fire many times. Many skulls are hanging from the roof. There is a statue of the four-winged god in each corner. Beneath it are the old runes spelling out the name *Pazuzu*. Whosoever utters his name three times will summon him. *Pazuzu* will be friendly and grant a wish, and take your soul (never to be resurrected again). To insult him will unleash an unholy blight dealing 20d6 damage to anybody within 10ft of the blasphemer; save vs. death for half damage.

1,The tunnel walls drop away into a black void and all you are left with is a stone bridge spanning the emptiness until it comes to apparently endless wall. There, the tunnel continues.
1,The tunnel turns into a passage hewn into the walls of a chimney descending straight into the endless netherworld. It goes on for hours before you finally reach the bottom and the tunnel resumes.

;road to Niflheim obstacle
1,There are bigger caverns to cross every now and then. Bats can be heard overhead and their excrement covers the floor. This particular cave, however, also hosts a family of [3d6] **wolf spiders** ([giant spider stats]).
1,[Yggdrasil camp]

;Yggdrasil camp
1,The tunnel opens out onto the bark of Yggdrasil, the world tree. The black void surrounds you. A path along the contorted roots leads you further down, into a little hollow where you can see a fire burning. The entry of the next tunnel appears to be guarded. [Yggdrasil raiders]

;exit to Niflheim
1,Finally, you reach a black lake in a giant cavern, the walls covered in green ice. Far above, there’s a round opening and from it descends a long iron chain with a big bucket at it’s end. Anybody entering the bucket is carried up, but there’s no boat to carry anybody out into the cold lake towards the elevator bucket. The bucket itself is operated by [1d8 trolls] ([troll stats]) living up above, at the behest of *Hel*.<p>[a sight of Niflheim]
1,Finally, the tunnels lead you to the underground [lair of the netherworld elves]<p>The [colour] gate from the [direction]ern courtyard is decorated with [Niflheim decoration]. It leads to the other side, to Niflheim.<p>[a sight of Niflheim]

;a sight of Niflheim
1,Overhead, grey clouds are blowing over the *[dark forest]* covered in snow. This is Niflheim, the land of eternal winter. [nearest objective in Niflheim]
1,It is dark, outside. You are surrounded by the giant trees of the *[dark forest]*. Overhead, there is a giant yellow moon. Wolves are howling in the distance. Soon, they’ll pick up your trail. [wolves or worse].<p>[nearest objective in Niflheim]
1,An acrid stench lies in the air. The outside world is covered in a warm, yellow fog that smells of metal, of burned flesh, of acid rain. A soft wind moves back and forth. This is the breadth of *Niđhöggr*, the gargantuan dragon sleeping amidst the roots of *Yggdrasil* somewhere down here in Niflheim, forever poisoning the world tree.<p>[nearest objective in Niflheim]

This festering castle is *Ejudnir*, *Hel*’s hall in Niflheim, guarded by [2d6x100] **trolls** ([troll stats]), watched over by [2d6x10] **harpies** ([harpy stats]), and filled with ten thousand despairing souls of cowards and the weak, moaning.<p>Truly, this is hell.

;small temple dedicated to Freya
1,[small temple]
1,The temple lies on a hill and boasts a great hall, a long house, where beer is always to be had. The walls are full of weapons and shields of famous patrons, and there are wood carvings of the *Freya*’s beautiful home in Asgard, the city of the gods, a realm all to itself.
1,The temple lies at the edge of the settlement, under some oak trees and with fields in the back. A few standing stones show *Freya* in her various guises over the course of the year. Sowing, growing, harvesting, and fighting. There are [3d6] [boars or wolves] living in the vicinity. The building itself is a longhouse with a grass roof.
1,The temple has a courtyard with the wooden statue of a wolf mother raising two human babies. The building is run by [2d6] **midwives** ([human stats]). Old *[woman]* is their spokeswoman. All the parents in this settlement know how much they owe these midwives, and they know it, too.
1,The temple belongs to the local [shield maidens], a society of armed women sworn to protect each other and their community. There are [3d6] **women** ([human stats]) led by *[woman]* living here and all are considered armed and dangerous by the locals.
1,The local priests have turned their attention on the sick and as their reputation grew, so did the number of petitioners waiting outside their hall every morning. There are currently [2d4] **priests** ([human stats]) under the guiding hand of *[woman]* tending the [3d10] sick and wounded.
1,This temple is run by the she-wolf **[woman]**. She is always in the company of her **winter wolf**, a beast as large as a pony, with red eyes and fearsome fangs.

;small temple dedicated to Odin
1,[small temple]
1,The temple houses an 8ft high wooden statue of *Odin* wielding his magic spear. An **old woman** named [woman with portrait] takes care of the temple. She knows the power of runes and will cast the stones for you, should want to locate a loved one or find a dragon.
1,The temple is actually a feast hall housing a small college of [3d6] **bards** led by [human with portrait].[store human as singing humanoid] During the day, they sing songs, practice balads, and compete in poetry. Their best known pieces are *[with story]* and *[and story]*. In the evening, the drink. All bards are expected to deliver a yearly donation for the upkeep of the college. Failure to do so results in being placed on a list. Should you need rescuing, they will contract a secret society to do that. Should you skip your obligation, they will contract a secret society to remedy that.
1,The temple is also a famous school for birds of prey. They are trained here and then sold to nobility in far away regions. The rich merchants making this trip often need guards and thus a mercenary house was established here. [mercenary house]
1,It was built generations ago atop a pool of Earth Blood by *Wise [human name]* in order to prevent its mutagenic power from corrupting the area. Many magic users and elves have come here over the years, drawn by the small eddies of magic energy still emanating from the sealed area: get one extra spell slot of your liking while you sleep nearby. *[inn]* was built next to the temple just for this. It’s run by the **inn keeper** [human with portrait].
1,The temple functions welcomes all wanderers and homeless people, housing people for up to week for a gold piece per person. This is the *[inn]* run by the **inn keeper** [human with portrait]. The common room has an entire altar built into it, including carved columns with eagles and ravens and showing *Odin* riding his eight legged horse over the rainbow bridge.

;small temple dedicated to Thor
1,[small temple]
1,The temple is in fact an altar built inside the village smith’s forge. This is where the strongest villagers meet every seven-night to discuss their grievances and resolve their issues. Money changes hands, children are promised into apprenticeship and journeymen are welcomed into the village. [local smith]
1,The temple is an altar at the foot of a big rock. The top has been hit by lightning countless times. Next to the altar is the wrestling field. Every festival involves wrestling and old *[human name]* is the most proficient **wrestler** here.
1,The temple stands in the backyard of *[human name]* the **chariot maker**. Inside it is a life sized statue of *Thor* riding a chariot drawn by two giant goats. The chariot maker is rich and has buried all his gold beneath the chariot.
1,The temple is one of the few places where they raise **giant goats**. There are currently [2d6] of these giant goats here ([giant goat stats]). The paintings beneath the roof show *Thor* riding his chariot pulled by his two famous goats. These giant goats are sold to [goat clients].

;small temple dedicated to Mitra
1,[small temple]
1,The temple stands on a little elevation, columns carrying a roof, and a stone altar in the middle, a smoking kettle containing the eternal flame that has been burning here ever since its foundation by *[an old hero]*. This sacred fire is the source for all the human fire in the valley.
1,The temple is dug into a hill, leading into a small chamber, big enough to barely fit twenty men. There’s a statue of a bull being stopped by *Mitra* herself. It is blackened by many years of blood and fire for the men swear to be like brothers of blood down here.
1,The temple looks like a tower, except that it has a big window from the bottom to the roof. On the inside, there are no extra floors. The room is simply 50ft high. The strip of light from the window falls on one of three oath brother statues in here, each raising their right hand, each pointing three fingers towards the sky. This is the bond of loyalty that makes us strong.
1,The temple has a door fit for a giant, but inside there is simply a strip of wooden flooring for petitioners to kneel and a big statue of *Mitra* standing blindfolded in a sea of fire, holding the balance of justice in one hand and the sword of judgement in the other.
1,A long set of winding stairs leads deep underground to a fiery pit. The fumes are intoxicating and the dreamy babbling of a woman’s voice can be heard but her words make no sense to you. She is one of the eternal servants, gifted to the temple by her parents and bound to pass through the lake of fire into Muspelheim, the realm of *Mitra*, whence nobody has ever returned. This is of course true: the lake of fire is a one-way gate to [a location in Muspelheim]. Most of these women eventually master the arcane arts of pyromancy.
1,Deep within the bowels of the earth, a pool of Earth Blood is being kept at bay by circles of banishment and stasis and thus evil **gorgon** and its poison remains imprisoned while these seals last ([gorgon stats]). The temple guards the entry to this underworld and the [2d6] **priests** and *[human name]*, the current head of the temple, inspect and improve their defences every year on the night of the winter solstice. The common folks just see the statues of the three oath brother statues here and come here to renew their bond with *Mitra*. They call themselves the *Oath Keepers* for this is what they do: they make their bargains here.

#lovingly transcribed/tabled from here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_colors_by_shade
#usage: Call Color, or Call a Shade. Tables are weighted somewhat to produce more common names
#maybe someday: subtables with HTML Color Codes in the ["color name" code] format for styling
#tint tables might also be a nice add (pale, deep, dark, light, etc.)
#I’ve tried to catch most of the "nouns" and append color names/colored to them so they’ll still parse ok.

;halberds & helmets: spellbooks
1,Each paragraph begins with the **spell name** followed by the spell circle in parenthesis (1–5), also known as the *spell level*.<p id="air-blast">**Air blast** (1) turns the exhalation of the caster into a blast of air that extinguishes candles and torches up to 30ft away. Flying creatures such as harpies or giant bees are automatically pushed up to 30ft away. When used on a surprised opponent, they are automatically *blinded* for a round (-4 to hit).<p id="air-surf">**Air surf** (1) allows you to glide for up to 300ft through the air at 60ft/rd. You cannot gain any altitude. As you glide through the air, you make no sound as you don't need to move.<p id="airstrike">**Airstrike** (5) gives you and anybody else within 10ft the ability to run through the air for 20min as if running on an invisible path created just for you.<p id="amnesia">**Amnesia** (1) allows you to look somebody in the eyes and lets them forget what just happened, up to ten minutes. At 5th level, victims can forget up to a day. This includes all the spells they memorised. Creatures immune to *charm* or <a class="spell" href="#sleep">sleep</a> spells are also immune to <a class="spell" href="#amnesia">amnesia</a>; anybody else must save vs. spells if they want to look away in time.<p id="animate-dead">**Animate dead** (3) animates the dead and turns them into zombies. You can control up to two times your level in a given round but you are free to animate more. Better keep them in a vault if you do, however. Freed, they'll roam the earth and spread like a plague because anybody slain by a zombie rises as a zombie within 24h. HD 2 AC 8 1d8 F1 MV 12 ML 12.<p id="animate-rock">**Animate rock** (3) animates a large boulders up to the size of an elephant (HD 9 AC 4 3d6 F9 MV 12). The rocks are pulled from their slow time into the present and it confuses them. They can be controlled for 1h if control slips, they are free to do what they want. Usually they run off into nearby hills and mountains before eventually slowing down again.<p id="animate-tree">**Animate tree** (2) animates a tree within 30ft of you (HD 8 AC 2 2d6/2d6 F8 MV 6). The tree speaks the language of plants which the caster doesn't automatically understand but the tree tends to attack fire bearers, axe wielders, and any buildings in the vicinity. Sometimes that is enough.<p id="artifical-life">**Artifical life** (3) animates matter and imbues it with life. A handful of gems are required to bind the magical energies. The value of these gems makes no difference. The HD of such a golem is limited by the matter used and it is limited to its creator's level minus one. Such a creature needs no rest, no food, no water and no friends. It does not sicken nor does it ever die unless destroyed by violence. Golems do not speak and are a bit dim. They don't use interesting tactics, they can't cast spells and they don't use ranged weapons, but they defend their creator at all costs, taking any blows aimed at them, if possible. Sadly, while most are loyal servants they still take a retainer slot. If their creator has more retainers than allowed by their charisma, the golems may malfunction and gain independence.<p id="aura-of-fear">**Aura of fear** (1) affects one victim within 30ft; they must save vs. spells or flee for as many rounds as you have levels.<p id="awaken-stone">**Awaken stone** (4) turns a boulder into a stone giant (HD 9 AC 1 3d6 F8 MV 6; surprise foes 1–3/6). The giant speaks your language and is as helpful as it can in the immediate situation. As soon as politely possible it wanders off to finally see the world after all these years.<p id="awaken-tree">**Awaken tree** (3) turns a tree into a treant (HD 8 AC 8 2d6/2d6 F8 MV 6; surprise foes 1–3/6). The treant speaks your language and is as helpful as it can in the immediate situation. As soon as politely possible it wanders off, wanting to finally see the world after all these years.<p id="ball-of-fire">**Ball of fire** (1) creates a big ball of rolling fire in front of you and sends it rolling towards a target within 60ft. Upon impact it explodes and deals 3d6 damage, save vs. spells for half. The ball must travel on solid ground and cannot cross water.<p id="bear-shape">**Bear shape** (2) turns you into a bear with big hairy arms, long claws and a terrible jaw with big teeth. Deal damage like a bear: 1d6/1d6/2d6. If both claws hit, a *bear hug* deals an extra 2d8 damage. Your attack, armour class and hit points do not change. Your strength bonus remains as is, including <a class="spell" href="#bear-strength">bear strength</a>, if any. Clothes and armour worn automatically warps and bends with you and still fits perfectly. The spell lasts for 20min.<p id="bear-strength">**Bear strength** (1) grants a target strength 13 (+1) for 1h. At 5th level, this increases to strength 16 (+2). At 9th level, this increases to 18 (+3). If the target is already that strong, nothing is gained.<p id="beauty">**Beauty** (2) turns you into a beautiful and alluring young woman for a day and a night, an eye catcher, one that makes others stumble and gawk. Your smell is intoxicating, your voice is bliss, your hair so beautiful people cry tears of joy when they see it. Anybody attracted to your sex must save vs. spells whenever they want to act against your wishes. If they make the save, they may move as they wish and say what they want, for an hour.<p id="bedazzlement">**Bedazzlement** (2) creates a 30ft radius aura around you. Nobody in range may harm or resist you unless they save vs. spells, or if you harm them.<p id="bend-space">**Bend space** (3) within 20ft for 10min: take steps 20ft longer, extend the reach of your arms by 20ft, grow the neck of a giraffe or the tongue of a frog. To the people around you, it seems as if your limbs are extremely elongated and thin and that your movements are quick and blurry but you don't feel weakened by this.<p id="binding-touch">**Binding touch** (4) charges your palms with contact power so that anybody you touch this round is bound to your hands the next round. Any damage you deal the next round applies to all the victims your touched this round. When running into a dense army formation, you will surely be able to touch two dozen people in a round.<p id="bird-friendship">**Bird friendship** (1) allows you to talk with all birds for a day.<p id="blade-storm">**Blade storm** (4) summons a magic blade for every level (minimum 7) from your palms and shoot it at a target up to 60ft away. Each blade deals 1d10 damage. You must roll to hit for every blade. No save. The blades rust away in a few days.<p id="blight">**Blight** (3) allows you to pick up to one target per level (minimum 5) within 60ft. Targets must save vs. death or start burning up from the inside as black fire consumes them: as long as you focus on it they take 5d6/rd until they are dead or leave the spell range.<p id="bolt-of-power">**Bolt of power** (1) shoots one unerring bolt of liquid sunlight dealing 1d6+1 to a target within 180ft. This increases to three missiles at level 5 and to five missiles at level 10. You may aim these missiles at different targets.<p id="bone-binding">**Bone binding** (5) is an ancient ritual by which you can boil away your flesh, and bind your own bones, turning yourself immortal. The spell slot for this spell is permanently bound to your bones and no longer available. You can no longer be healed but if your pieces are reassembled, you are restored within a week. You can never be killed, your bones cannot be broken, nor can they be burned, but they can be ripped apart and buried in far away places to break your power. Your soul, your senses, your power of speech, and your ability to cast spells remains bound to your skull for all eternity. And you *know* where your remaining bones are.<p id="bone-casting">**Bone casting** (2) enables the caster to throw bones covered in runes and read the fate of another person looking at the same runes. This reveals whatever awaits the other person within the time frame you are interested in: is there a trap behind this door, does an ambush await us on this pass, without revealing how this fate can be avoided.<p id="boneless">**Boneless** (1) allows you to bend your body into impossible shapes for 20min. You can move as if you didn't have any solid bones in your body such that you can squeeze through holes the size of a ring if you're not wearing a thing. Sadly, the things you wear remain as solid as ever.<p id="breath-of-cold">**Breath of cold** (3) creates a cone of cold up to 60ft long dealing 1d6 per caster level, save vs. spells for half. It also extinguishes all fires and freezes all water surfaces.<p id="breath-of-life">**Breath of life** (5) grants new, intelligent life to dead matter. You can grant new life to trees, rocks, corpses, statues, flames, anything you want. Their life is bound to the body you granted them but their soul is eternal, just like yours.<p id="breathing">**Breathing** (3) allows one target to breathe poisonous air for one day without suffering any adverse effects.<p id="bury-the-living">**Bury the living** (4) allows you to have the ground swallow a living being standing on it. They must save vs. death or they are buried alive in a depth unknown. There they remain in a magic stasis until the end of the world unless they are called forth by a reversal of this spell. Since they are not really dead, their soul remains imprisoned in their body and they cannot be raised from the dead unless they brought back to the surface. It is possible to cast the reversed spell without a specific target in mind, in which case a random victim of the past millennias is freed: a powerful and thankful non-player character of level 6+1d4 with all their equipment on them.<p id="call-of-the-wolf">**Call of the wolf** (4) summons 2d6 intelligent *shadow wolves* from the void between the realms. These stay for 10min: HD 2+1 AC 7 1d6 F1 MV 18; surprise foes on 1-5 in 6; only harmed by magic or magic weapons.<p id="calm">**Calm** (1) prevents 2d8 creatures you can see from attacking anybody for the next twenty minutes unless they are defending themselves. Even when attacked, the hold of the spell is not broken. As soon as the attackers put their weapons away, victims of this spell stop fighting at the end of the round. Victims are only granted a saving throw vs. spells if they are the same level as you or higher.<p id="camouflage">**Camouflage** (1) allows you to change colours for 1h. Anything you carry changes colour with you. As long as you're not moving, there's a 1–5 in 6 chance that people cannot spot you. People that have spotted you cannot be fooled again.<p id="cancellation">**Cancellation** (3) is a sign you flash with your fingers and a powerful hum that ends all spells and suppresses all magic for a round.<p id="chariot-of-fire">**Chariot of fire** (2) sets your chariot on fire such that anywhere you ride flammable objects start burning and anybody standing too close takes 1d6 fire damage, no save.<p id="charm-male">**Charm male** (1) affects a single male person¹ for a day, save vs. spells to resist. While charmed, victims treat you as their true love. To leave you is to die. To resist you in anything is impossible. If the charm is renewed daily, the target is unwilling to resist and thus remains forever enthralled as long as the spell is renewed. Once a victim break free, they remember everything they did and if they did anything they would not have ordinarily have done, they react with shame and anger. Charms usually cause severe emotional distress!<p id="charm-person">**Charm person** (1) affects a single target, save vs. spells to resist. To break free, victims save again every day if their intelligence is 13 or better, every week if their intelligence is average, or every month if their intelligence is 8 or lower. While charmed, victims treat you as their best friend. Once victims break free, they remember everything they did and if they did anything they would not have ordinarily done, they react with shame and anger. Charms usually cause severe emotional distress!<p id="clone">**Clone** (5) creates a perfect clone of yourself. The clone is in perfect cryostasis surrounded by white fog and bathed in blue light. Should you die or will yourself to rebirth, your clone awakens and you die. There can be only one! Any extra clones remain in stasis. Your later memories only transfer very vaguely to the clone.<p id="cloudkill">**Cloudkill** (5) calls forth a deathly cloud of yellow-green gas that spreads slowly for 1h with 20ft/rd, creeping along the ground, seeping into openings, killing any creature with less than 4 HD; creatures with more HD must save vs. poison or die. Even if they make the save, they take 1 damage/rd. Thus, remaining inside the cloud kills almost anybody. As it spreads for over a mile in all directions, it creates a true dead zone. Creatures immune to poison are not affected.<p id="club-of-law">**Club of law** (2) turns your own weapon into a searing weapon of light dealing an extra 1d6 damage. If your weapon is not magical, it now counts as a magical +0 weapon. The spells lasts for 20min.<p id="commune">**Commune** (4) gives you the voice of an angel with which to call on any divine powers, no matter how desperate your situation. Divine help might include your evacuation to the realm of the power you called upon, the arrival of a divine agent like a valkyrie.<p id="converse-with-corpse">**Converse with corpse** (2) allows you to contact the spirit of the dead and talk to them for half an hour if you are in possession of their skull. The more years have passed since their passing, the harder it is to understand them.<p id="creation">**Creation** (5) is like making a *wish*: use it to create or destroy inanimate matter as big as a ship. This takes 10min to cast. The creation is powered by elemental air. Using it to generate a ship of gold will work but it attracts other elemental creatures trying to right the imbalance: Jinn, Afarit, Ghouls or Marid, for example.<p id="curse">**Curse** (4) affects a visible target within hearing distance, or anybody who's hair you have in your fingers, unless they save vs. spells. Curses include *love* (intelligence 3), *weakness* (strength 3), *trembling* (dexterity 3), *sickness* (constitution 3), *coughing up worms* (charisma 3), *shape changing* (turn into an animal during either day or night), *bad luck* (-4 to all saves) and the like. When pronouncing the curse, you must mention a way for somebody to break the curse ("until kissed by a prince" or "until invited into a house", for example). The curse can be broken by a reversal of this spell.<p id="curse-of-drowning">**Curse of drowning** (3) allows you to pick a living and breathing creature and curse them to near drowning for an hour. They lungs fill with water, they cant speak, they can't cast spells, and they must save vs. death every time they attempt strenuous activity (such as attacking). If they fail, all they can do is gag up the water. If they fail twice in a row (easily avoided by simple not doing anything everytime you fail), you faint for 1d6 rounds.<p id="curse-the-land">**Curse the land** (5) enchants an entire region and places a curse on it, for example eternal slumber or permanent winter. The pronouncement of the curse must be followed by a feasible way to undo it and this possibility must be known to at least one witness. There is no other way to end this curse. As long as somebody else remembers the curse and the way to undo it, the curse is upheld. When the last person who knows how to break the curse dies, the curse is lifted. If the curse affects people directly, such as the eternal slumber curse, they must save vs. spells to be able to leave the cursed region.<p id="darkness">**Darkness** (1) with a radius of 60ft and a duration of 2h; anybody within it is blind (-4 to hit). Victims get a save vs. spells.<p id="death-ray">**Death ray** (4) is a ray of green energy that kills its victim instantly unless they save vs. death. Range 120ft.<p id="decay">**Decay** (4) is a curse that affects anything built by mortals: walls, buildings, ships, heirlooms. It doesn't matter. With a touch, you can speed up its decay by many magnitudes. Within minutes, it is visibly old and frail, after an hour or two parts are failing and within a day the structure collapses.<p id="detachment">**Detachment** (2) allows you to detach pieces of your body, and reattach them, as long as they haven't been separated from your body for more than 20min. This includes hands, eyes, and ears. You can still control detached pieces and you still see and hear and feel what they do. If you fail to reattach detached pieces, they wither and die and don't not regenerate.<p id="detect-magic">**Detect magic** (1) makes all magic items within 30ft give of a faint blue glow for 10min. Anybody can see this glow.<p id="dispel-magic">**Dispel magic** (3) will dispel ongoing spells and suppress magic items for 1d4 rounds.<p id="doll">**Doll** (4) allows you to create a doll of another person, if and only if you have a bit of their hair. This doll is linked to the owner of the hair. If you lift the doll and hold it close to your face, they can see your face, hear your voice, smell your breath, feel your touch. And you can hear them whisper with a very thin voice, too. And if you stab the doll with hot needles, if you set it on fire, then the other person suffers the most grievous pain and takes 1d6 damage per round until their organs rupture, their blood boils and their skin catches fire. It is a heinous way to go. And while they are dying, they – and anybody close to them – can see your face, hear your voice. They know who did it.<p id="door">**Door** (2) creates an unlocked door¹ in a wall you touch. The wall may not be thicker than a foot: you can enter many buildings but not pass through castle walls. The door is big enough for you to pass through comfortably and no bigger. The door remains until closed.<p id="dragon-tongue">**Dragon tongue** (4) grants you the ability to speak using the power of the first born. Any living creature thus addressed and able to hear must save vs. spells or obey your next ten commands for a minute. This includes suicidal actions. This mind fork causes severe emotional distress!<p id="dreamtime">**Dreamtime** (4) gives you and your pack (up to twenty people) access to the distant past, or maybe a past that never was, a time when humanity and wolves learned to hunt together, like sisters and brothers, one pack, one family. A place outside of time. This is where the big hounds hunt, this is were the immortals tread - the ones that simply never went back. They decided to remain here, where the glaciers are thick and strong and the tundra stretches forever. You can spend as many days and months and years here as you want. You age appropriately but still return to the present, if you return. By moving around in the Dreamtime, you also move your point of return.<p id="drowning">**Drowning** (4) fills a targets lungs within 60ft with water and kills them unless they save vs. spells. This spell has no effect on creatures that don't breathe air.<p id="eagle-eyes">**Eagle eyes** (1) allows you to see through the eyes of any bird you can see, for 20min. Simply look up at the sky, focus onto a bird and see what it sees.<p id="earth-blood-mastery">**Earth blood mastery** (5) enables you to find one of those rare spots where the Veins of the Earth meet and master their energy. From this spot, you can control the powers of creation. Within 120ft from this spot, you can create or destroy inanimate matter as you wish. This takes 10min.<p id="earth-blow">**Earth blow** (4) summons giant piercing steel needles from the Deep Earth, up to 60ft long, able to crush walls, split mountain sides, cause landslides and avalanches. This is the hatred of Earth made manifest.<p id="earth-ship">**Earth ship** (4) summons forth ship of stone that can glide through the earth while the sun is up. Only you can make it move. Without you, or without sunlight, it stops, resulting in a strange stone building. Similarly, the trail of destruction it leaves behind as it plows through the land is permanent: buildings are destroyed, trees are smashed, canals are dug.<p id="empathy">**Empathy** (1) allows you to know how one other person feels as soon as they look into your eyes. This lasts for 20min. They feel as if you were gazing into their soul, which in a way you are.<p id="energy">**Energy** (2) invigorates the beaten and the wounded. Lay your hands on a victim and restore 2d6+1 hit points.<p id="entrapment">**Entrapment** (2) creates a 10ft diameter trapped zone which wakes and alerts anybody nearby with a loud whistle if anybody steps into it. Victims must save vs. spells in order to move out of the zone. Flying over the entrapment avoids the trap. The entrapment lasts for 24h but the caster may end the spell at any time.<p id="eternal-starlight">**Eternal starlight** (2) can be cast on anything within 60ft; if you target anything with eyes, it must save vs. spells or be blinded (-4 to hit, no targeting of spells).<p id="exhaustion">**Exhaustion** (3) turn a whisper of yours into an enormous burden for anybody intelligent that hears you speak. Without needing to understand a word, people within 60ft drop to their knees, close their eyes, drop their weapons, pray for deliverance or start crying. Every round, victims must save vs. spells in order to recover their wits. While in this state of utter exhaustion, victims defend themselves but don't attack. If you are note brazen about it, you may pass amidst the victims without alerting them to your presence. Your allies had better cover their ears as you start whispering these words of despair.<p id="extra-arms">**Extra arms** (2) grows up to four tentacles for 20min. They act semi-autonomously, grabbing things within their reach, letting go if you move on, pulling them closer if you stand still. This is perfect for climbing rocks and trees, carrying things, and other simple tasks where you need to get a grip.<p id="extra-hands">**Extra hands** (3) grows six more human arms for 20min (up to eight arms). These arms are under your control and each can wield a weapon as well as you do.<p id="extra-hearing">**Extra hearing** (2) allows you to hear the faintest sound within 300ft for a day. Within this range, you hear anybody walking and overhear any conversation. At the same time, more than ten people moving or talking within range confuses you and any shouting or banging hurts.<p id="extra-pocket">**Extra pocket** (1) opens a tunnel to a pocket dimension behind a closed lid of a chest or inside a small pouch. There is enough space here for a big chest. Everybody casting this spell gets their own little place. If you cast the spell again, you can get to the things you placed there. They say that there is a way to get at other people's pockets but the spell to connect two pockets is lost.<p id="extra-room">**Extra room** (2) creates a little pocket dimension behind a closed door. When you open the door, it leads to a small stuffy room with space enough for four people to huddle on the floor. Closing the door a second time ends the connection between the door and the room. Anybody left behind is stranded until somebody else happens to use the same spell. This is why there always is a 1% chance of meeting somebody unimportant in the little closet.<p id="eyes-of-the-overlord">**Eyes of the overlord** (2) allows you to see anything invisible within 60ft. The spell lasts for 20min.<p id="eyes-of-truth">**Eyes of truth** (5) reveals all illusions, invisible things, ethereal beings, astral projections and whatever else there is. This spell lasts for 10min.<p id="far-seeing">**Far seeing** (2) creates a floating eye in your palm which you can send anywhere you like. Anything it sees, you see. It travels 60ft per round and lasts for 10min. It can see in the dark if you can see in the dark.<p id="fate">**Fate** (5) allows you to spin invisible threads of chance and fate to entrap a particular person. You can cover a 100ft cube in a day. When the person enters the area, they end up doing the things you suggested with your threads, if at all possible. Random events trigger reactions that lead to consequences that you have laid out when weaving the threads. The spell can be cast multiple times in order to affect more people. The threads linger for as long as the surrounding walls keep standing. The world is full of these threads, waiting for victims that have passed a way ages ago.<p id="feasting">**Feasting** (3) creates food and drink of the finest quality enough for a party of twelve for the entire day.<p id="feather-fall">**Feather fall** (1) allows you to fall any distance without taking any falling damage. This spell can be cast at any time, so as long as you are conscious, not gagged, and have at least one free hand available, you can cast it before hitting the ground.<p id="fire-proofing">**Fire proofing** (5) makes a location impervious to fire for a year and a day. This is how you secure buildings in Muspelheim.<p id="fire-resistance">**Fire resistance** (1) makes one target impervious to one die of fire damage per round. This means flaming oil does not harm you, flaming weapons don't deal an extra 1d6 damage on a hit, you can enter melee against somebody wrapped in a *fire cloak*, and so on. The spell lasts for 1h.<p id="fireball">**Fireball** (3) shoots forth a tiny, flaming missile flies for up to 180ft and explodes upon impact. Anybody within 20ft takes 1d6 damage per caster level (minimum 5d6). Save vs. spells for half. All flammable objects within the blast are set on fire.<p id="firetrap">**Firetrap** (2) draws invisible runes of power onto the ground in front of you. If anybody touches it, it all blows up for 4d6 damage, save vs. spells for half. These runes remain active until triggered, long after your death, if necessary.<p id="fist-of-air">**Fist of air** (1) enables you to air punch and have those hits travel through the air towards enemies for 10min. You must still roll to hit and you still apply your strength bonus to hit and damage.<p id="fist-of-death">**Fist of death** (5) is a strike with your fist which immediately kills the victim. You must still roll to hit. No save.<p id="flame-arrows">**Flame arrows** (3) fills a bucket or any similar container with a magic burning substance that can be used to dip arrows into it. This turns every arrow into a magic flaming arrow which adds an extra 1d6 damage to a hit. Up to 50 arrows can thus be lit. This liquid can also be used like flaming oil, burning for one round for every unlit arrow, dealing 1d8 damage every round until extinguished.<p id="flame-cloak">**Flame cloak** (1) surrounds you in fire such that anybody attacking you in melee must take 1d6 damage per round. The spell lasts for 20min or until doused by water.<p id="flaming-arrows">**Flaming arrows** (3) enchants a quiver or barrel containing up to 50 arrows such that an arrow drawn from this container burns with a golden fire dealing an extra 1d6 fire damage. After 20min, all remaining arrows lose their magical fire.<p id="flaming-blade">**Flaming blade** (2) turns any blade into a flaming blade dealing an extra 1d6 damage. If the blade is not magical, it is considered to be a magic +0 weapon. The spell lasts for 20min.<p id="flaming-sword">**Flaming sword** (2) turns a regular sword into into a flaming sword dealing an extra 1d6 fire damage. After 20min, the sword loses its magical fire.<p id="flash-flood">**Flash flood** (4) creates a sudden flood from a body of water within 150 ft. Anybody caught by it must save vs. death or be swept away. If wearing metal armour, save vs. death again or drown within a minute or two.<p id="flatten">**Flatten** (3) causes an air blast to flatten anything around you within 60ft if it isn't rooted in the earth. Creatures smaller than humans are thrown through the air, taking 1d6/10ft damage when crashing down. If they attacked you in melee, they take the full 6d6 damage. Human size creatures are blown off their feet and thrown back, taking 1d6 damage and granting anybody else still standing a +4 to their attack. Wooden doors, shuttered windows, glass, porcelain, clay and any other such structures are shattered.<p id="fly">**Fly** (3) allows you to fly at your walking speed for 2h.<p id="flying">**Flying** (3) allows you to fly at half you movement speed (like a person wearing plate armour) for 2h. When the spell ends and you are still flying, you fall and take the usual 1d6 per 10ft falling damage<p id="flying-bears">**Flying bears** (5) summons a sloth of 1d6+2 confused and angry flying bears: HD 8 AC 6 1d6/1d6/2d6 MV 12 fly; an extra 2d8 if both claws hit.<p id="flying-stones">**Flying stones** (1) causes a rock lying on the ground to levitate. You can move it around for 10min with the wave of a hand and with an air punch it flies off up to 120ft and deals 2d6 damage on a target, save vs. spells for half.<p id="focus">**Focus** (2) and all your melee attacks next round are an automatic hit dealing maximum damage.<p id="fortification">**Fortification** (4) protects a location such as a castle from arcane intruders for a day by creating magical fortifications and barriers which prevent any magical or summoned creatures from coming closer than 100ft and it prevents any magical effects from crossing the boundary: you can cast spells inside the fortification but you can throw a fireball from the outside at anything inside the fortification. The barriers do not dispell magic: a charmed person could still walk past the barrier carrying a magic sword.<p id="frozen-path">**Frozen path** (2) freezes water in front of you for as long as you concentrate. If you need to run, save vs. spells to keep the ice growing fast enough. The frozen path is 10ft wide and melts naturally. The ice can be broken by attacks dealing 3d6 damage or more. You can reverse the spell to create a water path through ice.<p id="frozen-slumber">**Frozen slumber** (4) allows you to freeze yourself or any target within 100ft. Inside the ice, your metabolism slows to a crawl, enabling you to survive centuries, if you want -- or imprisoning your foes for centuries, if you want. You have a vague idea of your surroundings while inside the ice and can trigger a thaw when you feel the time is right. When you die, anybody else you are keeping in a frozen slumber thaws.<p id="gallow-tree">**Gallow tree** (4) calls forth a permanent evil from Niflheim: a large tree bursts from the ground and snatches up to fifteen people within reach, trying to strangle them. When hit, victims must save vs. death or be caught; and if they are caught, they must save vs. or faint in the second round; and they are not cut down in the third round, they die. The tree keeps using its arms to snatch and kill until it has fifteen victims. These turn into loyal ghouls over night and are dropped onto anybody approaching the tree (HD 15 AC 8 *special* F8 MV 0; ghouls: HD 2 AC 6 1d4/1d4/1d4 + <a class="spell" href="#paralysis">paralysis</a> F2 MV 9).<p id="gaseous-form">**Gaseous form** (3) makes you malleable and gas-like so that you may pass through anything that is not airtight. It also makes you invulnerable to non-magical weapons. You may creep along the floor like a dying man on his hands and knees, or you may rise up into the air like smoke to be blown wherever the winds will blow.<p id="glamour">**Glamour** (2) is an illusion improving your looks in all respects, for a day: you look young and beautiful, your scars are gone, you smell of flowers, your voice is smooth and soothing. Like all illusions, anybody touching you may save vs. spells in order to see through it.<p id="golem-craft">**Golem craft** (2) animates clay. This requires a cheap gem set into the forehead of the little creature. A *clay* golem has HD 3 AC 6 1d10 MV 12. When you reach level 9, you can create a *stone* golem with HD 9 AC 1 3d6 MV 12. Such a creature needs no rest, no food, no water and no friends. It does not sicken nor does it ever die unless destroyed by violence. It is not affected by cold, fire, poison, sleep or charms. Golems do not speak and are a bit dim. They don't use interesting tactics, they can't cast spells and they don't use ranged weapons, but they defend their creator at all costs, taking any blows aimed at them, if possible. Sadly, while most are loyal servants they still take a retainer slot. If their creator has more retainers than allowed by their charisma, the golems may malfunction and gain independence.<p id="grafting">**Grafting** (4) enables you to sew together body pieces, such as attaching the leg of corpse to a person that has lost their leg. If you add more limbs than the target had when it was born, you have to add extra brains to control the extra limbs. In stressful situations (whenever you need to make a save) there is a chance that the extra brain acts on its own. The chance depends on the number of original limbs and extras: a human with an extra arm has a 1 in 5 chance of the extra arm acting on its own for a round, following a stressful situation.<p id="ground-strike">**Ground strike** (3) is a strike with your fist at the ground. A blast of air deals 3d8 damage to anybody within 20ft and they must save vs. explosions or be hurled away, clearing the blast area. They fall prone where they land and until they get up, all melee attacks against them get +4 to hit.<p id="grow-limb">**Grow limb** (3) makes an extra limb grow out of a body. It takes about ten minutes to form. For every limb you add beyond the number your brain was born to deal with, there is a cumulative 1 in 6 chance of it misbehaving in an emergency: a 2 in 6 chance you cannot take off with your two new dragon wings, or a 2 in 6 chance you cannot attack with your two new extra crab pincers. You could grow an extra head like an ettin and have it control the extra limbs. But then you'll need to make sure it stays loyal.<p id="guided-missile">**Guided missile** (2) turns a throwing weapon into a terrible projectile that tears through the air and unerringly strikes anything you've aimed it at within 120ft, doing triple damage.<p id="halt!">**Halt!** (2) Shouting this command forces anybody within 60ft to stop what they are doing and listen to what you have to say unless they save vs. spells. The spell ends when you move and individuals held break free when touched or threatened.<p id="haste">**Haste** (2) allows a target to *move* at double speed for as long as it can keep moving. Once it stops, the spell ends. Assuming a horse can move 20 miles without stopping, this spell allows it to travel 40 miles before stopping for a rest. A an ordinary horse can do this twice a day.<p id="heat-metal">**Heat metal** (1) heats metal armour within 30ft such that it deals 1d6 damage every round for 5 rounds starting *next* round. Jumping into water reduces this to half. It takes more than 5 rounds to take off armour, so that doesn't help.<p id="hidden-lands">**Hidden lands** (5) hides an island or some other area as large as a few miles across from the prying eyes of other people for a year and a day. Only you and the ones you designate can consciously pass through the veil. If you're unconscious, you may pass, thus survivors of a shipwreck might end on your island, for example.<p id="hold-monster">**Hold monster** (5) paralyses any 1d4 creatures for an hour.<p id="hold-person">**Hold person** (2) paralyses 1d4 human-like creatures for an hour. Human like creatures are not much larger than humans, made of flesh and blood, they have two legs, two arms, a head, and they can speak. Frog men are included, myconids are not; dwarves are included, giants are not.<p id="ice-bridge">**Ice bridge** (5) grows a bridge of ice from a patch of snow or ice you're standing on. The bridge can span up to 100m and is wide enough for an elephant to cross safely. The surface of the bridge is covered in snow and not slippery. The bridge collapses after 24h, or if the caster wills it so.<p id="ice-castle">**Ice castle** (5) creates a small castle of ice from a patch of snow or ice you're standing on, or expands an existing one. Every day you may add another building. Every time the castle grows, its power over the climate in the vicinity grows as well. If you're a long lived elf with a grudge, eventually the castle grows so large that it's influence causes another ice age with the entire continent covered in glaciers.<p id="ice-gate">**Ice gate** (5) weakens the veil between your location and Jotunheim, allowing you to shape a permanent passage. You can expand the dark space between the two realms, create a maze of black ice or a palace of glass, whatever you want, just as long as it remains connected at both ends. Naturally, the influence of snow and ice grow around the ice gate.<p id="ice-storm">**Ice storm** (3) lets the winds of the void crash through into our reality, drawing a line of ice and cold from you towards any target you point to within 120ft. Anybody caught up in the blast must save vs. spells and take 3d10 damage or be covered by magic ice. The magic ice weakens and breaks in 10min if the air is warm enough, or if it is smashed. If the ice is smashed, the victim takes an extra 3d10 damage and is surprised, granting a free round of attacks. The magic ice encases victims, paralysing them, but it also protects them from further attacks until the ice is smashed or weakens and breaks eventually. If the air isn't warm enough to melt the magic ice, encased victims remain frozen until it does, possibly for a *very* long time.<p id="ice-wall">**Ice wall** (1) pulls water up and freezes it into a thick ice barrier as big as a castle gate. This barrier has 2d6 hit points per level and AC 9.<p id="icicles">**Icicles** (1) lifts a cup of water per level into the air and turn each one of them into an icicle. Next round, you can shoot them at designated target within 60ft dealing 1d6 damage each, save vs. spells for half.<p id="illusion">**Illusion** (2) allows you to create and maintain an illusion as large as a house for as long as you concentrate on it. Anybody touching it may save vs. spells in order to see through the illusion. An illusion attacks like the caster but always has an AC of 9. Illusionary damage affects you as long as you believe it until you faint.<p id="immunity-to-fire">**Immunity to fire** (3) is a magic shield against all fire that lasts 1h. *Fireballs* explode without harming you. You can walk through the fires of hell without getting hurt. The shield has a diameter of 20ft, and may provide protection for an additional six people, even though you’ll have to move slowly.<p id="imprisonment">**Imprisonment** (5) allows you to put a dent in reality and seal of a pocket of time and space, imprisoning a target unless they save vs. spells. For the imprisoned, time passes but their body requires neither food nor drink, nor does it age. Thus, they cannot be resurrected, nor can they be recalled from an afterlife. The prison weakens within a day unless you spend 10min fortifying it for a year and a day. If you spend a day fortifying it, the prison lasts for a thousand years unless the seals are broken. Describe the seals and how they must be broken for this to occur.<p id="ink">**Ink** (1) turns the air you exhale charcoal black for 20min. Anybody within it is blind (-4 to hit). The blackness quickly spreads 15ft in every direction. A gust of wind disperses it.<p id="inner-peace">**Inner Peace** (3) ends all spells active on a target or in a location; it even suppresses the effect of magic items and other permanent magic effects for as long as you keep your eyes closed.<p id="invisibility">**Invisibility** (2) allows you to turn invisible until you attack a living creature. The spell can be reversed: an *invisibility purge* dispels all invisibilities within 60ft. Ethereal creatures or people shadow walking are not affected. The purge lingers for 10 minutes.<p id="invisible-claws">**Invisible claws** (3) focuses your hate into invisible claws or blades which whizz through the air, cutting skin and flesh wherever they can. Roll an attack on anybody within 60ft for every level of yours and deal 3d6 if you hit. No save.<p id="javelins-of-lightning">**Javelins of lightning** (3) turns ten javelins into <a class="spell" href="#javelins-of-lightning">javelins of lightning</a>. When thrown, these javelins are enveloped in chains of lightning and when they hit their target, they deal an additional 3d6 of damage, discharging the lightning. When left unused, the energy dissipates after 20min.<p id="joyful-dog">**Joyful dog** (1) gives anybody you touch a flash visions of puppies and happy dogs running around. This vision lifts their spirits and restores 1d6+1 hit points, up to their maximum.<p id="jump">**Jump** (1) enables you to leap up into the air and land safely up to 60ft away. You can also hurl yourself at enemies and deal double damage on a melee attack as you come down.<p id="kill">**Kill** (4) allows you see the life thread of a living target up to 60ft away and cut it. The target must save vs. death or die.<p id="laser-eyes">**Laser eyes** (3) grants your eyes the ability to shoot laser beams for 20min: one target per round must save vs. rays or take 1d6 damage. You can still act normally in addition to using your laser eyes.<p id="levitation">**Levitation** (2) allows you to defy gravity for 20min. Jump up and keep floating up, climb up vertical cliff faces effortlessly, but beware the end of the spell: you take the usual 1d6 per 10ft falling damage if you're afloat.<p id="lies">**Lies** (1) is a simple spell allowing you to tell any lie to a single person you have eye contact with. Others do not fall for this lie and can try to dissuade the victim from acting upon their belief but this doesn't change the fact that they continue believing the lie. Every morning, the victim must save vs. spells or continue believing the lie for another day. No save when being told the lie in the first place!<p id="light-beam">**Light Beam** (4) allows you or somebody you touch to take one single step and be instantly transported to any location you can see. It is said that none of those trying to reach the celestial bodies have ever returned, but who knows.<p id="light-foot">**Light foot** (1) allows you to walk for 4h without leaving any tracks. You do not sink into snow nor disturb any leaves. The grass does not feel your touch and the branches do not snap. You can surprise your opponents on 1–3 in 6.<p id="lightning-bolt">**Lightning bolt** (3) strikes any visible foe within 200ft and everybody standing between you and them, unless they're very small or lying on the ground. Anything within two feet of the bolt is affected and takes 1d6 damage per caster level (5d6 minimum), save vs. spells for half damage.<p id="ligning-bolt">**Ligning bolt** (3) is a javelin of lightning dealing 1d6 per caster level (minimum 5d6) to a target within 180ft and anybody standing between you and the target. Targets may save vs. spells for half. Wooden structures like shields, doors or siege engines hit are destroyed.<p id="like-grass">**Like grass** (4) allows you to ignore all bludgeoning damage and falling damage. If you're hit by clubs, hammers, maces, wrecking balls, rocks, or whatever else, you are simply flung aside and tumble and roll like a superhero, undamaged.<p id="like-leaves">**Like leaves** (4) allows you to enchant an area of 20ft diameter with up to 20 people in it (you included, if you want) in order to make them as light as dry leaves, and conjure up a strong gust of wind which blows all of them to any place you can see within one mile, allowing them land safely. Anybody trying to resist must save vs. spells in order to stay. Should they fail, they cannot land safely and take at least 1d6 damage if landing on solid ground, plus 1d6/10ft. falling damage for up to 10d6 if applicable (for a total of 11d6 maximum) and half damage when landing in water.<p id="limited-shape-shift">**Limited shape shift** (3) changes you into the animal you feel most connected to (and no other). The effect ends when you will it to end or when you die. Agrimach likes to move around as a wolf.<p id="liquefy">**Liquefy** (2) makes your jaw grow large, with acid glands, and if you manage to bite somebody in that very moment, they must save vs. poison or suffer 4d6 acid damage. If they're already dead, you can liquefy a human-sized corpse (and drink the goo, if you feel like it).<p id="locate-corpse">**Locate corpse** (1) allows you detect any dead or undead within 120ft. You can try and be more specific, focus on particular attributes of the corpse or even looking for a certain individual if you are in possession of a personal item or a part of their body.<p id="locate-creature">**Locate creature** (1) gives you a supernatural sense of smell for an hour. You can tell what kind of creatures walked over the ground or touched the surface you're sniffing. You can track them. You recognise anybody you've previously smelled with this supernatural sense. You can track creatures if you keep your nose to the ground.<p id="lock">**Lock** (1) locks any closed door¹ such that only the caster can open it. Doing so ends the enchantment, though. No amount of force can open such a locked door. Should a fire or earthquake destroy all the walls around the door, it would still be locked and surrounded by its frame. Digging a hole through the walls is probably faster than waiting for the door to rot and rust away. The reverse, *Unlock* unlocks any locked door that has been locked by mundane means (obviating the need for strength checks and battle axes). It does not unlock a magically locked door. You need to break the enchantment using a stronger spell.<p id="long-kiss">**Long kiss** (2) allows you to kiss somebody and create a special bond between the two of you. Both of you know where the other one is: you can feel how many days or hours you would have to walk in which direction in order to meet them. You may cut this bond at any time. If you don't, it is permanent.<p id="long-sleep">**Long sleep** (1) sends one target within 30ft into magical slumber. Unwilling targets must save vs. spells or succumb. This is a light sleep, so any subsequent noise wakes the sleeper. You may specify when the target wakes. Either way, the spell ends after a year and a day. At 5th level, the spell no longer ends on its own. At 9th level, the spell affects the area 60ft around the target as well, with the exception of the caster, if so desired. Anybody entering the area must save vs. spells or succumb. Once asleep, victims do not age, do not hunger, do not thirst, but rest and heal as well as they can.<p id="loud-whispers">**Loud whispers** (2) enchants an area as big as a castle for a day such that whenever you whisper within the enchanted area, your whispers carry everywhere.<p id="lunar-runes">**Lunar runes** (1) allows you to read and write the ancient elven runes powered by lunar magic for 20min. These runes are usually invisible or hidden within ornaments and other writing. This spell makes the lunar runes glow in a pale light, visible to all.<p id="lunar-sailing">**Lunar sailing** (5) summons a moon caravel. It appears within 10min and carries up to 20 people. The moon caravel can sail through shallow waters and on moonlit nights, it can fly up into the air and cross over into any of the other realms the navigator knows how to find using their star charts. Each chart names the location and realm it leads to. These star charts are therefore quite valuable. Sadly, mastery of this spell does not automatically grant you access to any star charts.<p id="madness">**Madness** (4) turns the world inside out: up to 60ft in every direction is transmogrified in the most terrible way possible. What is solid is now soft; what was meek is now terrifying; what was intelligible is now gibberish; the silence turns to thunder; the light turns to darkness. These changes are not symmetrical. Cluelessness does not turn to cleverness. Lead does not turn to gold. Usually this prevents both speaking and fighting but does allow anybody prepared for the chaos to move through the area, maybe grab somebody, pass through walls, and so on. Determine environmental changes affecting those around you (1d6): 1. acid rain deals 1d6 per round and dissolves organic material; 2. vampire anemones deal 1d6 per 10ft moved; 3. flying glass splinters blind unprotected eyes and deal 1d6 per round; 4. the floor turns into a tar pit, save vs. death unless flying and start sinking, suffocate in 1d6 rounds unless somebody unaffected aids you; 5. winds of madness make it impossible to hold onto anything that isn't securely fastened, anything flying not held fast is ripped into the space between the realms; 6. flesh melts, skin peels, intestines balloon, teeth crumble, hair falls, time and death are one and deal 1d6 per round (this damage cannot be healed, it returns at the rate of 1hp/night).<p id="magic-bow-and-arrows">**Magic bow and arrows** (1) summons a magic bow +1 and a quiver with 20 arrows. These last until all the arrows have been shot, the bow is released, or 20min have passed. The bow cannot be passed to anybody else.<p id="magic-kingdom">**Magic kingdom** (5) enchants an entire region and allows you to create illusions with semi-autonomous behaviour for two miles around you: a forest full of grasping roots, a candy land, whatever you want. The limitations on illusions continue to apply, however. Anybody touching an illusion may save vs. spells in order to see through the illusion. That is why the easiest illusions to maintain are scary illusions or unreachable ones, of course. An illusion attacks like the caster but always has an AC of 9.<p id="magic-message">**Magic message** (1) enchants a stone such that under the conditions named it speaks a short message. The conditions named must be such that the caster knows right then and there whether they are fulfilled or not. Thus, "when Orland the Wise walks by" is perfectly reasonable if the caster knows Orland even though the stone has no idea. On the other hand, "when the assassin of King Gerold the Good walks by" won't work unless the caster knows who it is.<p id="magic-shield">**Magic shield** (4) protects you for 2h from any spells up to the third circle and thus from all elemental energies such as possessed by dragons: *ice*, *acid*, *lightning*, *fire*. This spell does not protect against poison gas. You can suspend the shield to receive beneficial spells or to cast attack spells yourself, but this opens you to a counter attack until your get to act again.<p id="mastery-of-the-nine-realms">**Mastery of the nine realms** (5) transports you and anybody meditating with you for 10min to any of the eight known realms: Asgard (city of the gods), Alfheim (elves), Midgard (humans), Myrkheim (dwarves), Jötunheim (giants), Vanaheim (demons), Niflheim (trolls), Muspelheim (salamanders). Nobody knows what the ninth ream should be. Perhaps it's the space between the realms, the astral sea, or the world tree, Yggdrasil. You appear near a big and famous structures when you move to a new realm. When you return to a realm you have been to, you appear where you last left it.<p id="melting-walls">**Melting walls** (5) turns stone to mud. This is usually enough to breach almost all city walls. Basically a cube of 30ft on every side is affected, so if the wall is thicker than 30ft, it won't be breached by a single casting of the spell.<p id="mind-blast">**Mind blast** (2) turns a silent "boo!" into an overwhelming panic attack. 1d4 victims must save vs. spells or be knocked out for 10min. Those who make the save are still stunned for a round.<p id="mind-domination">**Mind domination** (4) blows away all integrity, all honour, all resolution, it softens the will and empties the mind. A single target within 60ft must save vs. spells or be utterly dominated by your mere thoughts for 10min. The victim can receive telepathic commands as long as it stays within range and will continue executing any commands given even if outside that range. No common language is necessary. Mindless creatures such as most undead are immune against this spell.<p id="mind-meld">**Mind meld** (4) allows you to bond with another being. If they are unwilling, they are granted a save vs. death. If you succeed, the two of you share a bond that goes deep: feelings, visions, individual words. The bond is permanent until you replace it by another. Spells that affect just you may affect the other person instead, if you so wish. Distance does not affect this bond.<p id="mind-reading">**Mind reading** (2) allows you to read one other person's mind as soon as they look into your eyes. This lasts for 20min. Lies are impossible. A victim may save vs. spells to realize what is going and and to hide their thoughts. Nobody can hide the fact that they are hiding their thoughts from you, however.<p id="mind-rot">**Mind rot** (1) confuses a target within 60ft for half an hour. They don't remember what they were doing, they don't remember their name, their friends, their enemies, their spells, the books they've read. Their soul is still here, their *feelings* are unaffected. But it's hard to act coherently if all you know is how you feel about people and situations. When the spell ends, the victims don't recall much, not even the moment they lost their mind.<p id="mirror-passage">**Mirror passage** (4) enchants a mirror such that it leads to the lands of the Red King, a realm built on top of a huge, ruined city and ruled by despotic nobles. From there, any mirror can be used to return to your realm of origin.<p id="misdirection">**Misdirection** (4) creates a magical maze protecting an area 100ft in diameter from discovery. This area is big enough for a nice camp site or a small house. Anybody entering the area from the outside without help from somebody inside must save vs. spells or pass through the area without discovering the protected area. They simply see whatever they expect to see around here: more trees, dark alleys, corridors and rooms, whatever is appropriate and soon forgotten.<p id="mishap">**Mishap** (1) is a very small curse on a target within 60ft: they must save vs. spells or fail their next action, no matter what it is: all their attacks, all their spells, all their movements. If they attempt to do it, they fumble. If they try to stab somebody with a sword, they drop it. If they try to sheathe their sword, they cut themselves. If they move, they stumble. If they speak, they mispronounce.<p id="moon-barrier">**Moon barrier** (5) summons a shining barrier lasting for 10min and protecting you from all magic including elemental damage and all ranged weapons. You can only be damaged in melee. You can still drown and you still die if you fall into lava.<p id="moon-blade">**Moon blade** (5) summons a shining blade of holy fire (+5 to hit, 2d6+5 damage) lasting for 10min.<p id="needles-and-puppets">**Needles and puppets** (1) is the art of making and enchanting little puppets made of straw and twigs and bits of cloth and lock of hair. Within ten minutes you can enchant the puppet such that it mimics the actions of the person whose hair you used: when they dance the puppet dances, when they fight, the puppet fights, and when they talk, the puppet yaps. Once per day you can stab the puppet with a needle the owner of the hair takes 1d6 damage. When reduced to zero hit points, they must save vs. death or die. You can enchant as many puppets as you have levels. If you enchant more, the older puppets gain independence and run away, trying to warn the owner of their hair.<p id="network">**Network** (4) allows you to tap into the network of living spiders all around you. Any spider within two or three miles in any direction can be contacted by you by simply projecting your mind, sending back the things they can hear and see. You can understand the words spoken and read written messages even if the spider whose sense you are using cannot. It is hard to project your mind into the void, looking for things you don't know. You must know the location or person or object you're interested in, for this spell to work.<p id="night-vision">**Night vision** (2) grants you and your pack (up to twenty people) the ability to see 60ft in moonlight or starlight. The only place your eyes still cannot penetrate is the absolute darkness underground.<p id="no-brainer">**No brainer** (4) grows four facial tentacles for 20min. On your next melee hit of creature with a skull no larger than a human, you deal no damage but grapple with your arms and facial tentacles. On every subsequent hit, your victim must save vs. death or have their brains destroyed by tentacles forcing their way through nostrils and eye sockets.<p id="observation">**Observation** (3) gives you the power to observe what somebody is doing, no matter where they are, if and only if you can eat a little bit of their hair. The target must save vs. spell in order to notice the strange presence in their mind. If they do, they may defend themselves with mind-affecting spells such as <a class="spell" href="#charm-person">charm person</a>, <a class="spell" href="#mind-blast">mind blast</a>, <a class="spell" href="#mind-reading">mind reading</a>, <a class="spell" href="#mind-rot">mind rot</a>, or <a class="spell" href="#warp-mind">warp mind</a>.<p id="one-thousand-fists">**One thousand fists** (2) gives you three melee attacks per round for the next 10min.<p id="ooze">**Ooze** (2) is a very limited shape shift. You can turn to a very slow moving ooze (AC 9 MV 3) and flow through the smallest cracks – but very, very slowly. The effect ends when you will it to end or when you die. You can pick any colour but you don't gain any special abilities, cannot speak and cannot damage anybody. You can suffocate a helpless person.<p id="open-mind">**Open mind** (4) opens your mind to the warp and the howling voices of demons from that void between the realms. They speak of terrible secrets that will drive any mortal mad. You have but a few moments to search for answers: ask a question and save vs. spells. If you fail, descend into madness for half an hour. This is why others often think it best to tie down and gag anybody about to open their mind to the warp! If you make the save, you receive an answer to your question. Note that the future is unknown and remains obscure even to the demons from beyond the pale.<p id="outgrowth">**Outgrowth** (2) allows organic matter to grow from your body: moss, mushrooms, grass, fur, horns, claws. You can use it to achieve perfect camouflage if you're immobile, to give off a flowery scent, or to grow fruit for somebody else to eat. You can command things to grow for ten minutes and once grown, these things stay until you cut them off manually. It takes two weeks for last traces to disappear.<p id="paralysing-punch">**Paralysing punch** (3) is a strike with your flat hand which paralyzes the victim for a minute. You must still roll to hit. No save.<p id="paralysis">**Paralysis** (2) affects one person within 30ft; they must save vs. spells or be unable to move for 1h as they experience death, burial or the pyre, worms gnawing at their bones, flames eating their face and the crushing weight of the earth. Paralyzed victims drop everything they are holding and collapse.<p id="part-water">**Part water** (4) allows you to travel through any body of water by parting the water. No matter how deep the ocean, you can travel along the sea floor. The partition holds for as long as you concentrate. Anybody caught in the water when the partition collapses must save vs. death or die. If they cannot swim or if they are wearing metal armour, they must continue saving every round.<p id="passage">**Passage** (3) enchants a closed door such that opening it creates a portal² to another, known door in the same realm. The portal remains active until the door is closed.<p id="permanent-darkness">**Permanent darkness** (2) with a radius of 60ft; anybody within it is blind (-4 to hit, no targeting of spells). If you target somebody directly, the must save vs. spells or be blinded.<p id="permanent-starlight">**Permanent starlight** (2) catches the surrounding light and liquefies it, and then it freezes the liquid light into a crystal which continues to shine for a hundred years.<p id="phase-walk">**Phase walk** (3) allows you to see the maze of crisscrossing lines connecting the realms and with one step, you can cross over to any of the eight known realms: Asgard (city of the gods), Alfheim (elves), Midgard (humans), Myrkheim (dwarves), Jötunheim (giants), Vanaheim (demons), Niflheim (trolls), Muspelheim (salamanders). You appear far from any watchful eyes but near a building. You can bring along whatever you can carry, i.e. one other person.<p id="plague-touch">**Plague touch** (2) turns you into a rotting half-corpse for an hour. Your skin starts peeling off, there's pus and other fluids, the smell is dreadful, and worst of all: it's contagious. Anybody you touch must save vs. poison or contract the same rotting disease. You loose half your hit points and don't regain them when the spell ends. Other victims you infect loose all their hit points but one within ten minutes and don't recover unless they undergo a week-long purification ritual involving a lot of bathing, fuming and changing of bandages.<p id="plant-growth">**Plant growth** (4) turns a 60ft × 60ft area of bushes or trees into a magical thicket in an instant. Machetes or something equivalent will be required to traverse this undergrowth. The spell can also be used to magically enhance larger trees, turning them into majestic towers, able to carry the weight of a large and beautiful tree house, or it can be used to grow trees into magical wooden river barges, or similar wooden structures. When dispelled, the material loses its magical hardiness but doesn't immediately turn to dust. The thorns lose their sting, the wood loses its fire resistance, its imperviousness to salt water.<p id="poison">**Poison** (4) instantly kills a victim touched unless it saves vs. poison. This spell can be reverted to *neutralize* a poison, bringing back anybody who died of a poison within the last minute and making them immune to poison for the next hour, allowing them to survive an oncoming <a class="spell" href="#cloudkill">cloudkill</a>, for example.<p id="portal">**Portal** (5) enchants a closed door such that opening it creates a portal² to any unused door anywhere in the nine realms. You can specify a building or a person and the portal created will connect to the nearest unused door. These doors are usually in deep cellars, attics, ruins, dungeons, sewers and the like. The portal is permanent until dispelled.<p id="possession">**Possession** (5) allows you to transfer your soul into a gem and from there you make take possession of victims within 120ft. They must save vs. spells or their soul exchanges places with your soul: they end up imprisoned in the gem and you end up in control of their body, keeping your intelligence, wisdom, charisma, level, class and alignment but getting the new host's strength, dexterity, constitution, hit points and all their abilities except for their spell casting abilities. If the gem remains within 120ft, killing the host simply forces your souls to switch places again, so their soul dies with their body where as you are back in the gem, ready to possess another body.<p id="prayer-for-help">**Prayer for Help** (5) summons an archon, a warrior angel (HD 6 AC 1 1W8 MV 15; immune to non-magical weapons; can see in the dark; can shape change into a dog at will; can sing the Song of Truth at will, can recite the Mantra of True Intent at will, and can use the Light Beam at will). This angel supports you for a particular task as long as your intent is sincere and serves the law.<p id="protection-from-cold">**Protection from cold** (2) protects you from ice storms and natural cold weather for 2h. If you are hit by a cold attack, you automatically take half damage. If a save grants you half damage, you only a quarter damage.<p id="protection-from-hail">**Protection from hail** (3) protects you from missiles of all sorts for 2h. Arrows, bolts and sling stones cannot pierce this shining shield, but rocks thrown by giant or spells still break through the barrier.<p id="protection-from-harm">**Protection from harm** (1) covers you shining armour made of solid sunlight granting you AC 4 against melee attacks and AC 2 against ranged attacks. This magic armour weighs nothing and allows you to swim. The spell lasts for 2h.<p id="psalm-of-the-beast">**Psalm of the Beast** (4) tames dangerous beast and befriends monsters unless they save vs. spells. You can tame as many hit dice as you have levels (at least 7). If you mistreat the victims, they may retry to save immediately. Otherwise, if treated with benevolence, they may retry their save after a week. Those who make the save start to recover gradually, so an observant spell caster can identify the troublemakers and charm them again.<p id="puppet-master">**Puppet master** (3) allows you to create a puppet of another person, if and only if you have a bit of their hair. This puppet is linked to the owner of the hair. Attach some strings to the puppet and you can control the movements of the other person. You cannot make them drop something, or pick something up, or say something, or eat or drink something, but you control their arms and legs. You can make them jump, dance, fall over, crawl. Anybody who can *see invisible things* can see and follow the strings that connect the puppet to its master.<p id="rain-of-fire">**Rain of fire** (5) opens a storm gate to Muspelheim, the realm of eternal fire. For a minute, a great roaring can be heard overhead and soot and ash fills the air, followed by 10min of liquid fire raining down, dealing 1d8 per round, setting all wooden structures on fire, killing everything that is not protected by a stone roof or impervious to fire. An area as large as a village can thus be levelled. Flying creatures immune to fire can use this gate to cross over into Muspelheim.<p id="raise-dead">**Raise dead** (5) brings a corpse back to life if they have died within the last seven days. It must not suffer from fatal conditions or it simply dies again (decapitated, broken spine, that kind of thing). You need to touch the corpse and it takes about 10min to animate. This usually involves the appearance of an *angel of death* dragging the kicking and screaming soul back into the living world.<p id="raise-stone">**Raise stone** (2) allows you to slowly raise a boulder as big as a carriage from the ground. Possible uses include blocking vehicles, creating a rampart, building a bridge, or rolling downhill. It is easily avoided by individuals under most circumstances.<p id="read-magic">**Read magic** (1) allows you to read and use scrolls.<p id="realm">**Realm** (5) enchants a closed door such that opening it leads to a little pocket realm, enough space for a building, a little land, some sky, a light above, breathable air, and everything else. Anybody casting this spell gets their own little realm. If you cast the spell again, you can reshape your realm at your will with godlike powers or change the door that leads to it. You cannot have more than one such realm and one such door leading to it.<p id="recoil">**Recoil** (1) turns you briefly into a horrendous monster in the eyes of anybody within melee range; anybody who sees you must save vs. spells or recoil in horror and be *stunned* for one round. To be stunned means that you cannot move and you cannot attack, but opponents must still roll to hit. To recoil means to take an uncontrolled step back.<p id="regrow">**Regrow** (3) regrows lost limbs. All limbs look like dark tentacles of the appropriate size, however. This automatically closes all wounds and stops all bleeding. The tentacles have a bit of autonomy and cannot be commanded to hold completely still. They are always exploring, grasping, holding on to things and picking up things. These tentacles can wield anything a human hand can wield.<p id="restore-faith">**Restore faith** (1) heals 1d6+1 points upon touching the target<p id="return">**Return** (4) allows you to create a silver thread that leads you and up to three others to a destination you have been to before. The thread leads through wrinkles in the barrier between the realms and thus effectively allows you to reach any destination in any of the known realms with no more than a dozen steps.<p id="river-travel">**River travel** (4) enchants a ship to travel up or down a river for up to 20mi, in but a moment, like a ghost, unseen but felt as a passing cold dread by people near the river.<p id="rock-swim">**Rock swim** (3) allows you to dive into the rock like a fish and "swim" for 10min and to glide through the earth up to 1000ft. If the spell ends while you're still gliding through the earth, you suffocate and remain stuck forever.<p id="rock-throwing">**Rock throwing** (3) allows you to pick up large rocks and throw them for 20min like giants do: roll to-hit as you would, deal 3d6 on a hit, no save.<p id="rope-command">**Rope command** (1) allows you to command up to 50ft of rope for 10min. It can slither like a snake, knot and unknot, trip people passing over it, and so on.<p id="scream">**Scream** (2) fills the air with an unbearable screech that causes the eyes and ears of mammals to bleed, blinding them for two rounds (-4 to hit) and prevents speaking and spell casting.<p id="scrying">**Scrying** (3) is the art of seeing far away places in the flames and smoke of a big fire. Stare into the flames for ten minutes, open your third eye, send your spirit to far away places and report what you see. You can only see what your eyes could see if you where there. No other sense is available to you. You must know the location or the person you want to see. If you are looking for a known person, the target gets a save vs. spells to avoid being scryed upon. Either way, they feel watched.<p id="sea-of-fog">**Sea of fog** (3) calls forth the fog spirits from a small lake or a larger body of water. Within an hour, the fog can cover an area so large it would take somebody half an hour to cross from one end to the other. This is large enough to fill the streets of a town, conceal a harbour, hide a reef, or cover a valley. Within the fog, visibility is limited to a few feet.<p id="servant">**Servant** (2) creates a magical servant of your devising, just for you. It can be a dead body given ghoulish life, a zombie, a talking crow, or an owl, or a dead knight, anything like that. If the servant is at least as large as a child, it can fight: HD 2 AC 9 1d6 MV 9. It might even wield a weapon and wear armour, if suitable a weapon and armour can be found.<p id="shadow-blast">**Shadow blast** (3) opens a rift to the plane of shadows and from it pours a fetid wind of some strange substance that grows cobwebs and shrouds as it blows, and anybody caught in it must save vs. spells or be blinded, deafened and stunned for a minute. An area about 20ft wide and 300ft long is caught in this storm. To be stunned means that you cannot move and you cannot attack, but opponents must still roll to hit.<p id="shadow-passage">**Shadow passage** (4) lets you travel through the shadow lands and take ten companions with you. You can safely travel this way up to one hundred miles during the night or while you are underground. For every extra hundred miles everybody on this trip must save vs. death or be lost in the shadow lands.<p id="shadow-step">**Shadow step** (2) allows you to step into the featureless shadow realm and move up to 30ft. This allows you to pass through walls, doors, ceilings and across chasms.<p id="shadow-walking">**Shadow walking** (4) is the art of opening a passage to the plane of shadows, a place where an endless labyrinth of ruins open to a dim grey sky above and a liquid darkness suffocates any travelers. Every hour spent on this plane costs a point of strength, but if you know where you want to go, every hour travelled here takes you a hundred miles in the real world. You and your companions emerge in a dark and murky place near your target destination. You may take as many people with you as will come but any whose loyalty is not certain must make a morale check or refuse. Strength lost recovers at the rate of 1/day.<p id="shadows">**Shadows** (1) reinforces the terrors of the night. When the sun has set or underground, all shadows deepen, all light grows dim, the grows cold and fear begins to spread. Units within 60ft must make a morale check or retreat. Individuals must save vs. spells or stay put, fearful of attracting the attention of whatever lurks in the darkness. The sound of combat dispels the effect. Otherwise it holds for as long as you concentrate on it. Your concentration holds as long as you don't attack, cast a spell, or take damage.<p id="shape-change">**Shape change** (4) allows you to change your shape. You get all the physical and none of the mental abilities of your new shape: basically you get the new looks, the movement, the AC and the natural attacks. If your new shape can fly, so can you. If it can breath under water, so can you. If your new shape can't speak, you cannot cast spells. If the creature you changed into can breathe fire, you still cannot: You don't get any magical abilities with the new shape. If you change into a monster, it may not have more HD than you have levels. If you are a level 9 caster and turn into a dragon, for example, your stats change to the stats of a blue dragon: AC 0 1d8/1d8/3d10 MV 24 (flying). You keep your hit points and to-hit scores since your class doesn't change. You return to your natural shape when you loose consciousness.<p id="sharing">**Sharing** (4) allows you to grow a shared understanding with anything alive within 150ft and to maintain this contact with the area for a day: to hear what all the plants can hear, to see what all the animals can see. Intelligent beings in the area must save vs. spells or share just like everybody else.<p id="shatter">**Shatter** (4) is shout of such terrible power that it breaks walls up to a feet thick and smash all wooden structures within 10ft, and when shouting at somebody in particular, the target must save vs. death or die.<p id="shield">**Shield** (1) gives you AC 3 for 2h as you can deflect blows and missiles using your bare palms.<p id="shield-wall">**Shield wall** (1) summons the broken palisades and splintered shields from the battlefields of Asgard to create a wooden wall 30ft wide and 6ft tall. Breaking down this wall requires ten minutes with axes or a battering ram, and even longer using fire. The wood is otherwise permanent.<p id="silence">**Silence** (2) prevents any sound from originating within 15ft of the target (usually a stone, up to 180ft away). Targets may attempt a save vs. spells to avoid the effect. This would prevent them from moving out of range. Nobody can speak or cast spells within 15ft of the target. As outside noise still enters the bubble of silence, victims may not immediately notice that they have been silenced.<p id="silent-message">**Silent message** (1) allows you to send a short message and receive a short answer without speaking any words. The recipient has to be within a mile. The message does not involve any mind reading so you still need to share a common language, and replying is optional.<p id="silent-paws">**Silent paws** (2) grants you and your pack (up to twenty people) the ability to run silently for 8h, if and only if you're not wearing metal armour.<p id="silk">**Silk** (1) allows you to weave up to 50ft of spider silk rope out of thin air. At night, it allows you to catch moonlight and weave the finest silk from it. A square up to 50×50ft of cloth can be created: nets, sails, curtains, you name it.<p id="siren-song">**Siren song** (1) gives your voice power over people: a single target must save vs. spells or be charmed when you address them. To break free, victims save again every day if their intelligence is 13 or better, every week if their intelligence is average, or every month if their intelligence is 8 or lower. While charmed, victims treat you as their best friend. Once victims break free, they remember everything they did and if they did anything they would not have ordinarily have done, they react with shame and anger. Charms usually cause severe emotional distress!<p id="sleep">**Sleep** (1) puts 2d8 HD of creatures to sleep. It works on friend and foe alike, so it cannot safely be used against foes in melee. Lower hit dice and lower hit points are affected first. No save. Creatures with more than four hit dice are immune.<p id="slipstream-travel">**Slipstream travel** (4) turns you and anybody else within 10ft into a magical dust that can follow any living thing as it moves through air or water for as long as you want. Usually, this is used to transport a group of people using birds.<p id="slow-time">**Slow time** (4) allows you to act four times while time around you slows to a crawl. Spells cast into slow time and attacks made in slow time take effect as time speeds up again.<p id="song-of-renewal">**Song of Renewal** (5) heals all wounds, even the fatal ones, it regenerates lost limbs and it mends broken bones. The only thing it doesn’t do is revive the dead.<p id="song-of-truth">**Song of Truth** (4) prevents anybody that hears it from speaking a lie while the song continues. Once started, anybody can continue singing it, extending its duration.<p id="song-of-speed">**Song of speed** (3) enables a target to move twice as far, attack twice as often, cast twice as many spells per round, for 10min, as long as you keep singing softly to yourself. When singing, you can't cast any other spells yourself.<p id="song-of-the-water-dragons">**Song of the water dragons** (1). Every river has a water dragon protecting it. Singing this song summons the dragon: HD 9 AC 0 1d8/1d8/3d10 F9 ML 9 MV 24 XP 3100; lightning bolts for 9d6, save for half. The dragon speaks the language of the locals but is not interested in performing any services. It is always interested in acquiring more treasure, though. Unless you strike a deal, the dragon takes the treasure of anybody present for the mere act of calling it.<p id="sorcerous-fumes">**Sorcerous fumes** (4) calls forth boiling fumes from the and sends them rolling in any direction you want at 10ft per round. Anybody caught in these fumes must save every round vs.~spells or fall unconscious as their mind is taken into sweet dream lands. If unconscious in water, drowns immediately.<p id="speak">**Speak** (3) allows you to speak to any intelligent creature and understand what it is saying. For the purposes of this spell, anything with a name is assumed to be intelligent enough to speak.<p id="speak-with-animals">**Speak with animals** (2) allows you to converse with animals of a particular species for 20min. A reaction roll might still be necessary because the animals are not automatically charmed.<p id="speak-with-skulls">**Speak with skulls** (2) allows you to reach through time and space into the afterlife and contact the souls that inhabited the skull you are holding. The conversation continues for as long as you keep talking. The soul is not necessarily friendly and cannot be charmed.<p id="speak-with-stones">**Speak with stones** (2) allows you to talk to rocks for 20min. Sadly, their perspective is limited by their rock nature. They may report things they heard or saw (if there was light), their memories go back a long time, but they can't tell individuals apart and their sense of time is confusing at best.<p id="speed">**Speed** (3) doubles your actions every round for half an hour: move twice as fast, attack twice as often. You can't cast twice as many spells because timing is important.<p id="spell-warp">**Spell warp** (4) disrupts magic around you. For up to 10min and as far as 60ft, reality is visibly changed: spiders crawl from their hiding places, mushrooms grow, snakes hiss, roots writhe, leaves curl, buildings groan, flowers bloom and die, spells cast fails spectacularly, magic effects are diminished, magic items screech and howl, all benefits are lost for the duration of the warp.<p id="spider-climb">**Spider climb** (1) turns yourself or somebody you touch into a half spider centaur for 10min. With your spider legs, you can climb along any solid surface or rope. With your spider silk gland, you can secure yourself against falls when jumping.<p id="spider-senses">**Spider senses** (2) allows you to enchant a target such that they are able to locate the smallest vibrations within 100ft using their fingertips. Anytime they touch the ground or a wall, they can pinpoint living creatures in range – as long as these also touch the ground or a wall! They can no longer be surprised. In addition to that, their heads grows six extra, sleepless eyes. This allows them to see in all directions, and to see additional colours like *jale* and *ulfire*. These eyes grant no mechanical benefits. The spell ends and the eyes disappear back into their surrounding flesh after half an hour.<p id="split-the-ground">**Split the ground** (4) allows you to smash your fist into the ground and split the earth. A fissure opens within seconds, and it keeps growing longer and wider while you concentrate. If you stand in front of people and you want the fissure to open underneath their feet, it will. Anybody within 60ft must save vs. death or fall, taking 8d8 damage. If you have the time, you can turn a peninsula into an island, or ruin a city, and if you're immortal, you can split a continent.<p id="stone-fist">**Stone fist** (1) raises your strength to 18 for 10min: +3 to melee attacks, 1d6+3 damage, smash doors on a 1–5 in 6.<p id="stone-growth">**Stone growth** (5) calls forth the Bones of the Earth and bends them to your will. Long columns of stone rise from the ground all around you and bend and twist as you like. If you use these to fight, you now have two melee attacks dealing 3d10 each and a reach of 60ft. After 10min these columns solidify and turn into a fantastic stone sculptures, towers, dams, or whatever else strikes your fancy. You can keep growing structures like that and build a mountain, if you have the time.<p id="stone-skin">**Stone skin** (3) turns your body to some sort of weird stone material: impervious to cold, fire, poison, and your AC goes down to 0. Also, you can no longer swim and you still need to breathe, so good luck with that.<p id="summon-ghoul">**Summon ghoul** (2) summons¹ a diminished lord of the earth, a ghoul; when you cast it for the first time, a special bond is created between you and particular ghoul. Future castings of the spell keep summoning the same ghoul. There can only ever be one such ghoul. It follows your commands but would love nothing more than to eat you alive. Through unspeakable acts anybody it seduces and kills rises as a free ghoul within 24h. HD 2 AC 6 1d4/1d4/1d4 + <a class="spell" href="#paralysis">paralysis</a> F2 MV 9 ML 9; <a class="spell" href="#aura-of-fear">aura of fear</a> and <a class="spell" href="#limited-shape-shift">limited shape shift</a> at will.<p id="summon-kraken">**Summon kraken** (5) summons a giant kraken from the depth of the sea. HD 12 AC 4 8×2d6 F6 MV 9 ML 10 XP 1200; anybody hit must save vs. death or be flung through the air. On land, take an additional 2d6 damage. On sea, fall into the water. When in the water wearing metal armour, save vs. death every round or drown.<p id="summon-living-storm">**Summon living storm** (5) conjures an elemental, usually the air elemental called Angry Whip: HD 16 AC -2 3d8 F16 MV 36; plus 1d8 vs. flying creatures; requires a save vs. death to approach; immune to non-magical weapons; attacks summoner and remains on this plane if the conjurer's concentration fails.<p id="summon-ursine-soldier">**Summon ursine soldier** (4) summons an unwilling armoured polar bear to join a fight: HD 6 AC 5 1d6/1d6/2d6 MV 9; an extra 2d8 if both claws hit.<p id="summoning-a-lord-of-fire">**Summoning a lord of fire** (4) summons an ifrit from Muspelheim.<p id="summoning-gate">**Summoning gate** (4) opens a calling portal to one of the nine realms and forces a native into your present realm. Such a native could be a troll, valkyrie, doppelgänger, elven noble, demon, naga or similar (usually around HD 6). Anybody casting this spell gets their own little ally. They stay for an hour before fading away. If they are killed, the spell has no effect for a week and then it will have latched onto a new ally.<p id="sun-chariot">**Sun chariot** (4) summons a flying, flaming, scythed chariot dealing 2d6 to anybody you ride past. It holds three people. The chariot is yours to command for 8h. Its movement rate is as fast as a wolf (MV 18).<p id="telekinesis">**Telekinesis** (4) gives you power over matter and gravity: fling rocks around, tear up the ground, rip open windows, crush everything. A volume of matter as big as cart (up to 20 humans) can be moved and thrown up to 200ft. When targets are hit by flying debris, or when targets are flung into solid objects, they take 1d6 damage per caster level (i.e. at least 7d6), save vs. spells for half. If dropping rocks on a target from high above, the usual 1d6 damage per 10ft applies (i.e. at most 20d6), save vs. spells for half. When living things smash into other living things, damage is split between the two (e.g. 20 humans dropping on a group of 20 humans from 200ft means 40 humans take 10d6 damage, save vs. spells for half).<p id="teleportation-trap">**Teleportation trap** (3) creates subtle changes in the configuration of space such that a group of people nearby is teleported elsewhere within 200ft without them noticing it. If the group of people stretches for more than 60ft (a line of twenty people), then the trap does not trigger. The trapped area radiates faint and harmless magic.<p id="tentacles">**Tentacles** (2) pulls water up and turns your two arms into watery tentacles with water drawn from a nearby source. This gives you two melee attacks per round for 1d6 damage each. At level 5 these arms can grow up to 30ft long.<p id="the-hymn-of-the-sun">**The Hymn of the Sun** (3) calls forth the punishing power of pure light. Raise your arm and a small gap in the fabric of the world between your palms opens and a burst of sunfire blasts everything in a straight line 180ft long and 5ft wide dealing 1d6/level (minimum 5d6) to anybody along its way, save vs. spells for half. The light is reflected by large mirrors at least 5ft tall and can be directed back at the caster or other targets within range.<p id="the-mantra-of-true-intent">**The Mantra of True Intent** (2) allows you to you to see the true intent of everybody within 60ft of you for 1h as a grimace on their faces. Whether they intend good or evil, their faces reveal to you their true intent as a beatific smile or as a spiteful scowl.<p id="the-prayer-for-the-light-of-truth">**The Prayer for the Light of Truth** (2) enchants an object to emit the light of truth. The effect is permanent until ritually defiled using blood and excrement or the like. With 30ft, one must save vs. spells or visibly hesitate for a round before committing an evil act such as telling a lie or attacking. Visibly hesitating before an attack prevents surprises and backstabbing. The aura of peace and benevolence is palpable.<p id="the-psalm-of-the-loyal-soul">**The Psalm of the Loyal Soul** (1) turns a humanoid into a standfast friend of yours for a day (no giants, no undead, no plantlings and the like) unless they save vs. spells. If you also treat them as your best friend for a day, then the friendship continues as if it had always been thus. If you are separate, the spell wears off after half the time: if you have been best friends for a week, the target remains your best friend for three more days. After that, old suspicions and negative feelings might return. If you betray the friendship, disappointment and rage replace the void you left in your target's heart.<p id="the-song-of-battle">**The Song of Battle** (3) enchants a sword pommel you must hold into a two-handed sword made of white light that lasts for as long as you proudly sing the song. It can cut through steel but cutting through a vault might take 10min. Against a living being it deals 2d6 damage.<p id="the-song-of-hope">**The Song of Hope** (1) summons a soft light in the darkness, covering anything within 15ft of the caster. To stand in the light is to be protected from fear and madness. The light follows the caster for 2h. When anybody within the light is attacked, the light flares up and blinds enemies of the caster (-4 to hit).<p id="the-song-of-life">**The Song of Life** (1) summons sunlight to shine on anything within 30ft. The undead cannot enter this light, and if they do, they are stunned for a round (they can move but no longer attack), and if they do not leave the area of effect on their next turn, they are now helpless (and can be killed with one blow). The undead can still hurt the people inside the light using magic or ranged weapons, of course. When the spell it casts the light grows quickly, but not quickly enough to trap any undead within range in the light. The light is immobile.<p id="time-stop">**Time stop** (5) freezes everything into place. Your arms are still free to act for as long as you like. Combine with <a class="spell" href="#bend-space">bend space</a> and <a class="spell" href="#extra-hands">extra hands</a> for maximum effect. Spell effects cannot leave your presence and all go off around your head when the spell ends.<p id="time-thief">**Time thief** (5) allows you to send your sense into the immediate future for a day and a night, giving you a chance to react appropriately, once per turn or once per fight: if anybody at the table announces an action or an event, you get two immediate, extra rounds to act in. If you are surprised, you lose one round, just like everybody else. The round you lose can be one of these extra two rounds, however.<p id="to-dust">**To dust** (4) transforms you and all you designate within 10ft into dust. Unwilling targets must save vs. spells or be turned to dust. If a wind blows, the dust is picked up and settles in a neighbouring region. Roll a die to determine the current wind direction when it has not been established. Use a d10 to determine where you are being blown: 1 = North, 3 = East, 5 = South, 7 = West, 9 and 10 = nowhere. Use a d8 when using a hex map. If you are blown out to sea, you are all going to drown, so don't do that. If there is no wind, you can call up a gust of wind to blow the dust for 60ft in a particular direction. There, you can lie in dust form for up to 8h.<p id="transfer">**Transfer** (5) allows you to exchange minds with a creature you are holding in your arms. Your brains must be similar enough for this to work. This is most likely limited to other humanoids of your approximate size. This effect is permanent.<p id="transmigration">**Transmigration** (5) allows you to leave your body and transfer your soul into arthropods of any kind: insects, spiders, crabs, no matter how big or small. You can spread your consciousness into many of these creatures and reassemble as large as your original body but made up of this vermin. In this form, you can deal 1d6 damage every round to a living creature and replenish any killed members from the environment as thousands of vermin stream towards you. The only thing that can effectively kill you is an area effect such as fire, water, ice, poison gas or lightning. You can hollow out a dead body about the size of your original body and take it over for a day. Beyond that, it gets difficult to hide the discolorations, the bad smell and the writhing vermin beneath the dead skin. Your original body will die within a day unless it's cared for by somebody. Then again, if it dies, who cares. You're practically immortal, now.<p id="transposition">**Transposition** (5) allows you to move yourself and all the objects and creatures within a hundred paces with you into another realm. This is how an entire castle can be moved to a different realm. The transition takes a few moments so anybody at the edge of the area of effect must save vs. spells if they want to avoid the transposition.<p id="tree-jump">**Tree jump** (2) allows you to step into any tree and out of any other tree within 100ft, up to ten times in ten minutes.<p id="true-words">**True words** (2) allows you to look into the eyes of people and read their feelings, see their imaginations, and hear their thoughts unless they save vs. spells. These secrets are revealed to you across all language barriers. In order to learn something specific, the target must also think about it. How you make them do it is up to you. The target will know that you are there inside their head.<p id="unbound">**Unbound** (5) frees you from the world's shackles. No barrier can hold you, nothing can touch you; you can move through your current realm by a thought alone. This means that you still need to know the way in order to get to your destination, but if you don't care about the destination, you are truly free. Not even gravity can touch you. Sadly, the passage of time remains unaffected.<p id="vacuum">**Vacuum** (5) is the spell to end all life. Cast it, and a black sphere of utter cold spreads around you, growing at 30ft/rd up to 300ft. Inside this sphere, the cold is so absolute the air itself freezes and falls like snow. This is the cold vacuum of outer space. Any living thing except for you must save vs. death every single round or die. You can see up to 10ft inside the sphere. You may move up to 30ft/round and uphold the sphere although it won't grow while you move, thus the edge never travels faster than 30ft/round. The spell ends when you decide to no longer uphold it or when you are in danger: if you take damage or when you roll a saving throw. When the spell ends, the sphere starts shrinking at 30ft/round until it disappears. You may cast no other spell while upholding the spell.<p id="vanishing">**Vanishing** (4) creates a link between you and your current location. With a simple thought you may instantly teleport yourself and anything you are carrying back to this location. This link remains until triggered or until replaced by another such link. It doesn't matter where you are in the nine realms: this link brings you back. For the purposes of this spell, assume that you can carry another person, maybe two if they are as small as a child, like halflings or dwarves.<p id="visiting-the-afterlife">**Visiting the afterlife** (2) enchants the sleep of a person touched such that they can visit their heart's desire in the afterlife – a deceased loved one, for example. Their soul spends two hours in this realm, be it Asgard or Hel while their body is caught in a magical slumber from which nothing can wake them. Unwilling targets get a save vs. spells before succumbing.<p id="voice-of-the-master">**Voice of the master** (4) dominates a creature to serve you. You need to speak a language it understands for it to obey specific commands. If you don't, you are limited to whatever you can convey without words. The spell lasts for 10min.<p id="voice-of-the-ruler">**Voice of the ruler** (1) convinces a person that that hears you that you are to be obeyed unless they save vs. spells. This servitude continues as long as you want. Victims are granted a new save every week and whenever they are forced to do anything that they really hate to do.<p id="wait">**Wait** (4) allows you and up to twenty companions to enter a special trance that removes your bodies from the time stream. Your minds still observe the spot where you entered the trance, but nothing can affect you unless you want to return into the world. No time passes for you, but you can spend centuries outside the time stream.<p id="wall-of-fire">**Wall of fire** (4) creates a stationary wall of fire 300ft wide, 30ft high and 10ft deep. This is enough for a circle with 50ft radius. No animal will cross it and any other creature doing so takes 2d8 points of fire damage. This wall lasts for 20min or until dismissed.<p id="warp-flesh">**Warp flesh** (4) slashes at the barriers of the realms and allows these vortexes of madness and mutation into the world, transforming flesh and bone: Anybody within 60ft must save vs. death or undergo terrible mutations: roll a d12 and replace arms with tentacles (1) or claws (2), unable to hold anything but doing 1d6 damage; replace legs with tentacles (3) or flippers (4), allowing you to swim but not to walk; replace lower half with the body of a giant spider (5), allowing you to climb but giving you AC 6; rip the skin of your face (6), reducing you to 1hp but allowing you to see all things invisible and hidden; transforming you into a slow-moving ooze (7) with AC 9 but allowing you to seep through the tiniest cracks; grow long spines 1m long from your body (8), unable to run or hold anything but anybody attacking you with a one-handed melee weapon is takes automatic 1d6 damage; split into two opposed clones (9); your eyes melt and your blood thirst surges (10), attack random people nearby at -4; a necroworm infestation increases your hit-points by 4d6 (11) but when the spell ends and the worms die, suffer 4d6 damage; sucked into the void (12) and spewed back out when the spell ends. The spells ends after half an hour but the voices in your head don't stop for a few days.<p id="warp-gate">**Warp gate** (5) opens a gate into the space between the realms and the madness of the void coagulates into demons of the most terrible kind (HD 8+1 AC 5 1d4/1d4/1d6/1d6/1d8 F16 MV 18 ML 11; flying; only harmed by magic or magic weapons). You can keep the gate open for as long as you want. Every ten minutes, another demon steps through. These demons want to destroy and kill, and as long as you can offer that, they'll follow your command. When you stop, however, the demons don't disappear.<p id="warp-mind">**Warp mind** (3) tears at the barriers between the realms and these vibrations and the glimpses of the void are so terrible that they shatter the minds of many: anybody within 60ft must save vs. death or go stark raving mad for half an hour. Victims attack random targets!<p id="water-breathing">**Water breathing** (3) allows one target to breathe underwater for one day. While breathing underwater, you can speak the languages of all marine creatures.<p id="water-walking">**Water walking** (1) enables a target to walk on liquids for 20min. Usually, this means water, but it might also be lava or quicksand. This spell does not protect against the heat or noxious fumes.<p id="water-way">**Water way** (3) allows you to redirect a flow of water 5ft wide within 300ft. It will even flow through the air for as long as you concentrate. Anybody can swim through the air in the floating water. Even small canoes and the like can travel along these redirected water ways.<p id="wave">**Wave** (1) moves a body water such that a wave 10ft high forms and moves in any direction you want. If you can, you may surf on it. If the wave crashes into land, it deals 2d6 damage to anybody within 20ft. The wave keeps moving as fast as a human can run for as long as you concentrate.<p id="web">**Web** (3) allows you to fill a 10ft cube with sticky spider webs. You need surfaces to anchor the web. Anybody caught in the web is automatically immobilised. Without outside help, it's practically impossible to free oneself from the web. A slow death awaits anybody caught. The web doesn't burn very quickly: to free a passage filled with these webs using fire takes 10min per 10ft. Anybody caught in a burning web takes 2d8 damage as they free themselves. Anybody caught in a web with a torch automatically sets it on fire and is thus automatically free after 10min.<p id="wellness">**Wellness** (4) turns a hall into a lush paradise according to your wishes: palm trees on a sandy beach or high trees around a dark pool of cold water, or hot springs amidst snow: whatever weather, plants and water will allow without actually building anything. This spell must be renewed once a week or this oasis loses its magic and fall apart within a month.<p id="werewolf">**Werewolf** (3) turns you into a werewolf: immune to normal weapons. You can fall from incredible heights without taking damage. Fire and ice won't harm you. Only silver or magic weapons can hurt you – or spells. Additionally, your natural AC goes down to 5 if it isn't better, and you can bite for 1d10, if you want.<p id="whirlwind">**Whirlwind** (4) transform you into a little whirlwind, destroying wooden structures and dealing 2d6 to anybody in melee with you. Any enemy taking damage must save vs. death or be flung back for a few yards.<p id="whisper">**Whisper** (1) sends a short message to any creature you have touched in the last few weeks only for them to hear and transports back their short reply, only for you to hear, if given within a few seconds. If they are asleep, the message wakes them up.<p id="wind">**Wind** (2) calls forth a favourable wind. The wind steadily blows up to 2h in the direction indicated. This is ideal for sailing ships or land gliders. Anybody blown away by the wind travels as fast as a pegasus (the fastest creature known).<p id="wind-barrier">**Wind barrier** (3) prevents any flying thing from reaching you for 20min. Arrows, sling stones, rocks flung by giants, projectiles shot by siege weapons, all are deflected.<p id="wings-of-god">**Wings of god** (3) allows a target to fly for 2h. Their movement rate is half that of a person running (MV 6).<p id="wolf-howl">**Wolf howl** (2) is a supernatural howl that alerts all the wolves within a mile or two. These wolves understand the short message you have sent and act upon it, if they can. In forests, mountains, ruins, savannas, or swamps 3d6 wolves appear in 10min and stay for up to an hour, if you want (HD 2+1 AC 7 1d6 F1 MV 18).<p id="wolf-pack">**Wolf pack** (3) turns you and your pack (up to twenty people) into ordinary wolves: HD 2+1 AC 7 1d6 F1 MV 18. The wolf's hp may not exceed the target's current hp. All targets can turn back to their true form whenever they want, or when they are reduced to 0hp. Any hp lost as a wolf remain lost when returning to their true form.<p id="wolf-tongue">**Wolf tongue** (1) allows you to talk to all sorts of wolves, dogs and hyenas for an hour.<p id="world-walk">**World walk** (5) gives the music you play a special power: as you walk and play, you can move yourself and anybody visible whom you want to take along to a similar situation elsewhere. Surely somewhere in the nine realms a similar situation is unfolding: describe a simple change to the environment using your music, weaken the barriers between the worlds and start walking. Thus, if you're surprised by an enemy army as you're crossing a river, you could be transported to Vanaheim, into a different ambush but on dry ground, or still standing in a river but no longer under attack.<p id="worm-summoning">**Worm summoning** (2) grants you ability to summon a giant worm in 10min (30ft long, HD 6 AC 3 1d8 F3 MV 60 ML 9 XP 600; swallows victims on an attack roll of 19 or 20, swim through earth). The worm stays for 2h and can travel up to 20 miles in flat terrain; it carries up to five people. It can also dig a tunnel 2 miles long using it's Earth Blood magic, but the tunnel closes again after a bit such that only 10 people may safely follow it below ground.
