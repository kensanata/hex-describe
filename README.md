# Hex Describe

This application takes a map generated by *Text Mapper* and a set of
random tables to generate a textual description of the region. It's
ideal if your players are wandering into unprepared regions, and it's
great if you need some seed material to base your work on.

You can provide your own random tables if you have the file online
somewhere in a [Pastebin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastebin) or
shared it from Dropbox, etc.

The format is simple: every word in the map description and every two
word combo from the map description is a potential table in your file.
If it exists, it will be used.

Assuming the following description:

```text
0101 dark-green trees village
```

The description will be generated from any tables that match:

* dark-green
* trees
* village

It would make sense to just provide tables for "trees" and "village",
for example.

Tables looks like this:

```text
;trees
1,some trees
1,you encounter [forest monster]

;forest monster
3,[3d6] bandits
1,an elf
```

A semicolon and some text begin a new table. A number, a comma, and
some text are an entry in the table. The text needs to be on one line.
The numbers are relative probabilities. The chances for an encounter
in the forest are thus 50% and the chances to encounter an elf, if you
are encountering anything at all, are 25%. The example also shows how
you can link from one table to another using square brackets.

Square brackets are also used for dice rolls. A dice roll can look
like this: 3d6, 3d6+5 3d6x10, or 3d6x10+5.

There's an built-in help page with more details for end users. If you
intend to host the application yourself, use `perldoc hex-describe.pl`
to get a more technical documentation based on the comments in the
code.

The app comes with a tutorial built in. See the
[Help](https://campaignwiki.org/hex-describe/help) link.

## Dependencies

Perl Modules (or Debian modules):

* Array::Utils or libarray-utils-perl
* IO::Socket::SSL or libio-socket-ssl-perl
* LWP::UserAgent or liblwp-useragent-perl
* List::MoreUtils or liblist-moreutils-perl
* Modern::Perl or libmodern-perl-perl
* Mojolicious or libmojolicious-perl
* Text::Autoformat or libtext-autoformat-perl
* File::ShareDir or libfile-sharedir-perl
* File::ShareDir::Install or libfile-sharedir-install-perl

The IO::Socket::SSL dependency means that youâ€™ll need OpenSSL
development libraries installed as well: openssl-devel or equivalent,
depending on your package manager.

To install from the working directory (which will also install all the
dependencies) use cpan or cpanm.

Example:

```bash
cpanm .
```

## Installation

Use cpan or cpanm to install Game::HexDescribe.

Using `cpan`:

```shell
cpan Game::HexDescribe
```

Manual install:

```shell
perl Makefile.PL
make
make install
```

## Configuration

In the directory you want to run it from, you may create a config file
named `hex-describe.conf` like the following:

```perl
{
  # error, warn, info, or debug
  loglevel => 'debug',
  # undef means stderr, or a file name
  logfile => undef,
  # undef means the default directory, or a directory name
  contrib => 'share',
  # the URL where you run Text Mapper to generate maps (optional)
  text_mapper_url => 'http://localhost:3010',
  # the URL where you run Face Generator to generate faces (optional)
  face_generator_url => 'http://localhost:3020',
}
```

Depending on the complexity of the tables and the size of the map,
generating a new document can take a long time. By default, the
inactivity timeout is 30s. One way to increase it is to set the
`MOJO_INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT` environment variable. See the
`Mojolicious::Guides::FAQ` man page for more.

## Deployment

Deployment is a little tricky because you don't want to install the
web app as the sole web app. This requires a "mount" that associates a
path such as `/hex-describe` with the real Hex Describe. The following
tiny web app does that, assuming that Hex Describe is available from
the same directory as the Perl interpreter. I saved it as
`/home/alex/farm/hex-describe.pl`:

```
use Mojolicious::Lite -signatures;
use File::Basename;

my $dirname  = dirname($^X);

plugin Mount => {'/hex-describe' => "$dirname/hex-describe"};

app->start;
```

Here's an example service file for systemd. It uses a specific Perl
interpreter I installed using Perlbrew, calls the script that mounts
the real Hex Describe and serves is on localhost port 4010:

```
[Unit]
Description=Hex Describe
After=network.target
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
[Service]
Type=simple
WorkingDirectory=/home/alex/farm
Restart=always
DynamicUser=yes
MemoryMax=300M
MemoryHigh=280M
Environment="MOJO_INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT=60"
Environment="PERL5LIB=/home/alex/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.40.0/lib"
ExecStart=/home/alex/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.40.0/bin/perl \
 /home/alex/farm/hex-describe.pl \
 daemon --mode production -l http://localhost:4010
```

I use Apache as a reverse proxy so that I can use the web server's
features to renew the certificate, block bots, rate limit, and so on.
Here's part of the config file:

```
MDomain campaignwiki.org
<VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerName campaignwiki.org
    SSLEngine on
    ProxyPreserveHost On
    RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Proto "https"
    ProxyPass /hex-describe http://localhost:4010/hex-describe
</VirtualHost>
```

## Development

As a developer, `morbo` makes sure to restart the web app whenever a
file changes:

```bash
morbo --mode development --listen "http://*:3000" script/hex-describe
```

Alternatively:

```bash
script/hex-describe daemon --mode development --listen "http://*:3000"
```
